2930834;`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Aristotle himself called the Spartans a monarchy numerous times in the Politics.  I don't understand why you keep trying to call them a republic.  Furthermore, your comments above don't seem any improvement to me on the language in the article now, which is very clear that republics come in many shapes and sizes (in fact, limiting them all to two so-called models seems more restrictive to me than it should be).  Use of the words ``genus`` and ``species``, as I've remarked to you before, is a misapplication of taxonomy to political science.  It may be useful for purposes of casual analogy, but we cannot resort to it in an encyclopedia article, or we will confuse and mislead our readers.  You have yet to demonstrate that any authority refers to a government such as that current in the United Kingdom as a republic.  As noted in this paragraph, Aristotle himself describes Sparta as a monarchy  one in which the monarch held weakened powers, yes, but fundamentally part of the ``monarchy`` category.  Your ideas have the merit of being an unusual take on republics which has given all of us cause to consider political terminology, but I am afraid your quotations, though well cited, do not appear to me to compel us to accept your two model theory of republics  it's original research, something Wikipedia is not.   `;914;1.0

3798128;`I was sad to see that you're going to be away for the next week, because as you're coming back, I will be leaving for the summer after that.  I want you to know that despite our disagreements, I really appreciate what you're trying to do.  It's difficult for most people to write a truly NPOV article, which is why what Wikipedia does is so great.  By having hundreds of thousands of authors, almost every point of view is represented, and people are forced to compromise, usually resulting in pure truth.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnfortunately, the Holocaust is one of the few subjects where this doesn't work.  It is a subject which should be purely history.  The Nazis kept spectacular notes on everything that they did, and it should be spectacularly easy to say ``this here is exactly what happened.  We know, because of the monthly reports written by Himmler.``  Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers continually show up, most of whom have no interest in truth or even compromise.  They tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda.  This is just who they are.  They cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from Hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``The Jewish Problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the same time, I can't exactly claim to be NPOV either.  It is fairly clear from what I have already written here that I hold Holocaust deniers in no high esteem.  Quite frankly, I find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people.  It is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the United States, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten.  It would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the Jews.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument.  I would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes.  Holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-Semitic.  My personal favourite group believes that Jews are shape shifting lizards from Mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity.  And yes, this group has a following.  The ``Holocaust Revisionist`` lines and the ``Jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door.  The people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-Semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what Hitler started.  I encourage you to write carefully about what they believe, but please don't be fooled by them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wish you the best of luck.   `;370;1.0

But that's not the point here. It's a fact that these floppies have been called 5¼- and 3½-inch and that has to be seen in a historical perspective. The fact that the 3½-disk is actually 90 mm in size has also been clearly stated in the article. (It might have been called a ``90 disk`` or something similar, if it was invented 10 years from now ) And even when using the metric system, you'll sometimes run into ``misnomers``; if you bought a 2½-litre car it is highly likely that it sports an engine with only 2,4895 litres of displacement.  07:36, 2004 May 21 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKEN`";2087;1.0

However, Wikipedia is not designed to be used purely by Wikipedia editors or those clued up with its conventions (nor those willing to take the time to discover them), but by anybody who wants quick and helpful access to a topic.

I do, however, have to disagree with some of the minor changes you've been making in a couple of paragraphs where the author/editor has chosen to itemize his/her arguments.  For example, at Bee learning and communication, someone wrote ``The primary lines of evidence used by the odor plume advocates are 1) clinical experiments with odorless sugar sources which show that worker bees are unable to recruit to those sources and 2) logical difficulties of a small-scale dance...``   You changed those to ``(1)...`` and ``(2)...``.

Biri's death is not part of the al-Aqsa Intifada because the intifada started after his death - after Ariel Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. You see, that's how it got the name ``al-Aqsa``. The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the ``Palestine Facts`` source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada.

According to the U.S. Department of State, ``Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall.

9534738;"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne reason given was that the posts were anonymous.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis was dismissed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSomeone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat too was dismissed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTherefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTwo choices.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStop posting completelyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTry and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHence the challenge.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFinally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   ";520;1.0

One of Wikipedia's strengths, I think, is that it serves as a respository for underground and pop culture  there've been several times when I've come here looking to understand some term or phenomenon and been rewarded.

But I haven't heard one comment from either one of you on the actual topic of discussion which is the rumour listed about about Rumsfeld.  I will repeat.  Remember you really shouldn't lecture someone about sticking to the facts at hand unless you yourself actually comment on the facts at hand, which you haven't done yet.  Unless there is some evidence provided for the Rumsfeld rumour then it will NOT go into the article and if anyone puts it in the article then I will rip it out.- NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN;1117;1.0

Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of ``cleansing actions``, ``master races`` and ``aryanism`` were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  ``Judaism:  evils of``; ``Judaism, need for dissolution of``.  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, ``that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .``  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not ``Nazis``  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.  The Club of Rome banner is one that Javier Solana flies the most proudly!`";3121;1.0

Then you proceeded to ridicule what you perceive as my religious beliefs, while simultaneously confessing to me the past two days (if it wasn't one more blind) your faith in Haile Selassie, the long dead ruler of Ethiopia as God Almighty!

11681871;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Wikipedia ``Patricia Cornwell`` page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe main Wikipedia ``Patricia Cornwell`` page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDemand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the Wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates Wikipedia's own policies.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe page is the alleged biography page for author Patricia Cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under Cornwell's influence or on her payroll. These partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases Cornwell.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am Patricia Cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by Cornwell.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Wikipedia main page on Cornwell is a brief piece of pro-Cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. A large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes Cornwell committed against me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. Your Wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPatricia Cornwell is a longtime friend of the President Bush family and some FBI agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour Wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal Cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. A few words of sycophantic praise for Cornwell, and then a brief section on ``Controversies`` which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when Cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are invited to read Cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, ``Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness``. Researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on Cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a Wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt seems the main purpose of your current short Wikipedia Cornwell ``biography`` page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on Cornwell.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the Cornwell partisans who control the Wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-Cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe specific attacks on me in your Wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with Cornwell's hired thugs. Regarding the specifics of these false statements:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article accuses me of making public ``plagiarism`` accusations about Cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. The Wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. The Wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the Cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the Republican Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper by the Cornwell lawyers themselves. The Times-Dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to Patricia Cornwell, and the ``reporter`` who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe actual facts are that I publicly criticized neo-Nazi activities by Cornwell, her written threats advocating book-burning and the banning of free speech, and her demands that I be totally silent about her. The Cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of ``plagiarism`` after Cornwell already re-wrote her book, accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between Cornwell's book and my earlier novel. But it does not disclose the fact that Cornwell re-wrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor;131;1.0

12179805;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are many issues involved here, beyond what any individual might wish to see or not see, and the overall effectiveness, popularity, and usefulness of this project is I believe at stake. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe issue of the particular image in question has been closed for the time being, Though curiously it was closed immediately after someone posted a note questioning the claim of its supposed ``free-use`` copyright status, which actually, to my knowledge had not been investigated. It is my understanding that the image is now ``safe`` from further debates about its inclusion for at least a month. I can accept this. I do not in any way accept the idea that the case, or the issues that it raises, are closed, and that myself or anyone should simply ``shut up`` about it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn another issue that my activity has raised: I do generally deplore notifying people of things to which they have not expressed any indications of wanting to be involved with in any way, and whether for commercial, political,  or general social goals I would indeed consider that ``SPAMMING``. I  would prefer to consider what I have done ``targeted campaigning`` upon an issue, in which a very strong and very clear consensus that had been indicated in no uncertain terms was CERTAINLY being ignored and evaded. Very contrary to some people's  assessments and accusations against me, I had NO intentions of keeping my actions secret, nor disguising them in any way. I actually expected people's reactions to them to further publicize the issue in question, and that is exactly what occurred. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo the minority of those who I contacted who were in any way offended by my attempts to notify them of what was occurring, I can and will apologize, and I ask their pardon. The responses that were generated would indicate that the majority did not feel that way. What I would consider genuine ``spamming``, or at least the most obnoxious extremes of it, is engaged in by people who are well aware that hundreds or thousands of people will be burdened and offended, for every one who might respond positively to their actions, much like the posters of these photographs, which most people DO classify as hardcore pornography, normally limited to ADULTS, including the providers of the images.

12740225;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==One-sided debate?==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to engage Pollinator on his claims that I am ``rewriting`` my opponents viewpoints. The following things should be considered: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) Wikipedia has one viewpoint, that of an encyclopedia. No part of no article can be said to be off-limits to editting.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) I have tried to be reasonable with Ungtss (the editor of the article who is trying to impose his own POV). As it currently stands he wants to have a ``counterpoint`` defense against the criticisms section. This is unacceptable because there will be no end to the point-counterpoint style of an article. If he wants to make points, let him do it in the article itself.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3) Two of the arguments are not only specious, they're based on poor research on the part of Ungtss. I have explained this all above.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTherefore, it is unreasonable for you to revert the edit which has added quality to the page.  `;53;1.0

He now admits he invented the story about Solana being considered the friendliest child in his grade school class.  I was quite surprised to learn this as I honestly thought maybe SqueakBox had information which could be useful to me in the book I am writing about Javier Solana as well as my Wikipedia contributions and blogspot articles.  I asked him for his source and he publicly posted that he got it from the same place as I got that Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana.  The problem with this is that Ariel Sharon really did refuse to meet with Javier Solana and SqueakBox deleted that reference from Wikipedia and defamed me all over the web by falsely claiming I had fabricated that information.  What was fabricated was Squeakbox's claim that the evidence (and website links were posted at the time) did not exist.  J'accuse SqueakBox of intellectual dishonesty to the detriment of Wikipedia and I will be seeking to have him permanently banned from Wikipedia.

15883286;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Leaning a little left of neutral ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter reading just the second paragraph (regarding the UN), I have to say the facts are clearly one sided.  Isn't it true that the ``Oil for Food`` scandal would/has clearly influenced the members on the Security Council?  That the Members on the Security Council had very large economic interests in Iraq and would loose them if there was a war, and now the clearly vocal SG of the UN now being implicated in influence in the ``Oil for Food`` scandal.  These facts would clearly give the reader a better understanding of a possible reason why the UN acted the way it did.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe last and final resolution did warn Iraq of possible military solutions, if it did not comply.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne could clearly argue whether this is relevant or not, but just declaring that the Security Council was against the war without the above mentioned is avoiding reality.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI stand corrected this whole passage leaves out many important facts.

(you'll need it. heh heh.)  14:10, 2005 Jun 18 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*I agree with you completelly. I'm glad you mentioned this on the talk page ahead of time as somebody who does lean a little left of center would certainly change your edits. This article needs to be rewritten. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Well, pick out a chunk that is the worst example of the POV you're objecting to, and either fix it, or, if you want to increase the odds that it will survive for a while, hammer out a suggested alternative here on the talk page.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Absence of declaration of war: police action==NEWLINE_TOKENThis article is titled 2003 invasion of Iraq, which is perfectly fine and NPOV, but to claim in the opening paragraph that it is a war is to miss the essential fact that there was and has been no such declaration of war.

Isn't it true that the ``Oil for Food`` scandal would/has clearly influenced the members on the Security Council?  That the Members on the Security Council had very large economic interests in Iraq and would loose them if there was a war, and now the clearly vocal SG of the UN now being implicated in influence in the ``Oil for Food`` scandal.  These facts would clearly give the reader a better understanding of a possible reason why the UN acted the way it did.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe last and final resolution did warn Iraq of possible military solutions, if it did not comply.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Please don't delete or edit other people's comments ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCheeseDreams, please don't delete or edit other people's comments on the Talk pages. You've done it to me personally twice now (that I've noticed), once in the talk page of the Cultural and Historical Jesus, and (at least) once before on the Wikiproject:Jesus discussion page, when you made most of the discussion of Christology in the strikethrough font. You seem to be relatively new to Wikipedia, so I'm asking nicely. Say what you need to say, but let others say what they say and let their words stand on their own. Thank you.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:If you mean a comment in the summary, that is because I summarised the text. Your comments can be viewed at archives 2-5.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And on Wikiproject:Jesus, I struckthrough (but did not delete) items which had been actioned. This is the standard practice for todo lists is it not?NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I meant the comment on the summary itself, encouraging people to read those archives instead of relying on someone's summary. On Wikiproject:Jesus, the text you marked as strikethrough were not part of a todo list, it was a discussion of whether to do anything with Christology at all. In both cases it appears that you were trying to delete or conceal my objections to your proposals, rather than actually respond to them. Maybe that wasn't your intention, but it certainly had that appearance.  \NEWLINE_TOKEN:::It already says that the full text is in the archive, and that the summary is by me, and disputed by you.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::W.r.t. the wikiproject, if you note the talk page, you will see that I struck through everywhere that there was discussion which I had actioned. If I had intended to delete or conceal your objections, I would merely have deleted the text, or put    tags round it.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Also regarding your summary of Slrubenstein's comments, ``yanking someone's chain`` doesn't have anything to do with masturbation in the U.S., at least when used in the context Slrubenstein used it. It just means he wondered if FT2 were saying things just to get a reaction from him. That's probably an honest misunderstanding between the two of you, but it might be helpful if you acknowledged it and corrected that part of your summary. Thanks.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::If Slrubenstein agrees to retract his uncivility toward FT2 such as ``charicature of a nut``, ``ar eyanking my chain``, ``your reasoning is specious and ignorant``, and apologise for them, then I am perfectly willing to remove the comments from the summary. Until that time, they remain, since this is how I and other non-US (remember that the majority of english speakers are not in the US) readers read the text.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I have also just looked the phrase up in a slang dictionary, and cannot find an alternative meaning to the phrase.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: I agree, most English speakers are outside the US, so it's a very understandable misunderstanding. Here are links to a couple of definitions that I think are better than the one I gave, and probably closer to what SLR meant: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yank+one's+chain and http://www.ozyvoyuer.com/aussieslangdictionary.html#Y. (The second looks Australian, so it's not a strictly US-centric usage.)   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Arbitration==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks for pointing me in the direction of the RfA. A lot of familiar names in that crew! I don't know that I'd call them a cabal but I know what you mean. They've learned that the best way to push a POV is to gather a small gang. The way Wikipedia is structured it's easy to subvert consensus by doing so. I'll try to have a look at what's passed and if I can comment constructively, I'll do that.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegarding arbitration, CheeseDreams, I was not implying at all that I didn't agree that I should recuse myself  I did so, as I hope you noticed.  I was noting that it is Arbitration Committee practice for someone involved peripherally in a dispute (or directly, of course) to recuse themselves, and that in the past no one has needed to prompt arbitrators to do this.  We're intelligent, we're committed to fairness, and we police ourselves pretty effectively in this regard.  I was just wishing you'd have given me the courtesy of waiting to see if I would recuse myself from the case, rather than assuming I wouldn't.  I will note, though, that the standard you suggest is generally considered too high for arbitration here.  In a case like yours, it's obvious that with so many involved parties (in a relatively small community), all of those people will know at least one arbitrator  mere acquaintance does not require an arbitrator to recuse.  We recuse when we're involved in the case itself, or when one of the involved parties is either a long time enemy or close friend.  If arbitrators could only hear cases involving users they had never before encountered, we couldn't arbitrate any case effectively.  Just thought I'd offer my thoughts, and let you take them as you please.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn another note, I am not sure if it was you who wrote the phrase ``cabal of 'fundamentalists'`` in your arbitration request, but if you did, I'd suggest to you that it might be wise not to use that phrase.  The list of users who oppose you includes at least one very dedicated atheist and at least one other person who is openly hostile to Christianity  characterizing the list as ``fundamentalist`` will be seen as a blanket generalization.  Obviously you can do as you please, but I think other users will notice the word and the users, as I did, and be confused or else draw negative assumptions (i.e., characterizing atheists as ``fundamentalists`` might be seen as an indication that one is hasty to judgment, etc.).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, I'm sure you don't much like getting a note from me, so I'll disappear, but if you ever do feel like talking, I want you to know that I'd be happy to.  As I hope you can see above, I'm not ``out to get you``.  I'd like to understand you a little better, and I'd like to be able to work with you productively if I can.  If you'd like to talk about it, drop me a .  Thanks,  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Unlike most of the arbitration committee, as far as I am aware, you have actually engaged in debate over controversial issues with me. I regard that as being ``an involved party``.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:No, I wrote the phrase 'cabal of ``fundamentalists``', please note the quotes around the word ``fundamentalist``NEWLINE_TOKEN:I have absolutely no issue with getting a note from you.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::I'm glad  here's another note then.  You seem to misunderstand me (perhaps I'm not communicating well).  I have agreed with you on two separate pages already that I most certainly am an involved party.  I don't want to sound at all rude, but I have to admit that your continued responses to me are making me wonder if you understand what I mean when I say that I have ``recused`` myself from the case.  If I am wrong, please forgive my suggestion.  But if you are unclear on what it means, it means that I have openly declared that I am an involved party and that I will not offer any arbitrator opinions (or any votes) on your case, should it be accepted.  I apologize if it is unclear  I had thought that ``recuse`` was common in the English court system as well, but I confess I do not know it well, and perhaps that is the source of the confusion.  As far as the quotation marks around ``fundamentalist``...well, as I said, it's your choice.  I can't claim that I understand what difference in meaning is implied by the quotes, but I don't suppose it's important for me to understand.  Thanks for replying nicely  I apprecia;1376;1.0

The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Wikiclique ==NEWLINE_TOKEN(Regarding an irate comment I made in response to reading the word ``wikiclique`` on the Village Pump)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI didn't mention you as one of the Wikiclique, though you seem sensitive on the subject. The word Wikiclique is an accurate description of some Wikipedians behavior. That can't really be denied. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Rather, the word ``wikiclique`` is a schoolyard insult that can only serve to infuriate the very people with whom you are trying to reach consensus.  The issue you're raising on the Village Pump is important, but I feel that your vituperance is diminishing it and alienating others.  If you expect civility, you must be civil yourself.  . NEWLINE_TOKEN:Clearly NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== beta Systemic Bias section ==NEWLINE_TOKEN(Regarding gathering support for removing the systemic bias from the Wikipedia)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi, if you wish to help contribute to a beta version of a Wikipedia page section designed to counter-act Wikipedia's systematic bias, please sign the bottom of this section on the Village pump - Wikipedia:Village_pump#Systemic_bias_in_Wikipedia. If not, no worries. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I can't sign yet; I need to know more.  All I gleaned from your conversation is that you feel an emphasis on things less important than the Congo Civil War and the Holocaust constituted a bias.  What other articles do you feel betray this bias?  What, to you, is the set of articles that, when expanded, will counteract aforesaid bias?Alternately, if you don't have a clear idea of what precisely is causing the bias, then why raise such a ruckus about fixing it?  None of us know or can predict what makes you feel that the Wikipedia is biased, and we all have different ideas about what articles need emphasis.  You'll need to help us out and flesh out your idea more.I think the present method (i.e., let people work as they will) is the best solution for the moment.  Eventually, every important topic will get covered, even if the fanboys get to write their novels and video games into the Wikipedia first.  . NEWLINE_TOKEN::Your characterisation of my argument doesn't match with what I think. I mention the demographic make-up of Wikipedia, and how this influences the character of Wikipedia. Rather than gleaning, read the arguments carefully. I am not suggesting changing the current methods of editing Wikipedia. My idea is merely a small addendum to the many ways articles are brought to peoples attentions.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Merging Afghanistan ==NEWLINE_TOKEN(Regarding my request to merge List of leaders of Afghanistan with Heads of Government of Afghanistan)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi Ardonik - NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks for your message.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI didn't want to duel-post a template - and I hope it wasn't too much of a surprise!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs you will see - there has been a lot of discussion/contention about lists of rulers etc. and what suits one person is an anathema to another. So it was ironic that another variation has been thrown into the equation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to arrive at a uniform format for all these lists - and I think that it is achievable - but may not be to everyone's taste.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is how I see it:-NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHead of State is the 'modern' generic label for a 'ruler' of an independent state.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are some regions which are not independent states (those located in African countries, for instance) which it would be right to use the term 'rulers' for the leader.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHead of Government is a generic for the primary official in the government of an independent or non-sovereign state.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor clarity I like to try to avoid 'concurrency' on a single page - unless it is unavoidable, the page should comprise a single chronologically consecutive list and the phrase to present should only appear once on the page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome lists are quite long already, and I am aware that to combine lists would put some people's backs up.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut then again, to combine some and not others would be inconsistent and would vary how people approach each list.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway,  as I say this is only how I see it.  The concensus should prevail - and if hundreds of people disagree with me (rather than the odd one or two) then sobeit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am always open to working in collaboration in the project. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHope my reasoning makes some modicum of sense.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks again for your message.  Speak soon.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Although it doesn't sound as formal, perhaps ``List of leaders of X`` could serve the combined role of ``List of X-ish heads of state`` and ``List of X-ish heads of government.``  After all, the world leader is timeless, while the word state meant nothing before the advent of the modern nation-state.  (Just a proposal.  I'm not sure of precedent or what the current convention is leaning towards right now.)  . NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I'm just concerned that that might sound ambiguous - and someone is bound to jump up and down about a perceived ambiguity!  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::You have a good point.  I meant ``leader-as-in-an-executive-office-holder-or-similar-position,`` not ``leader-as-in-role-model.``  For me, ``Leader of Afghanistan`` pretty clearly refers to the person calling the shots, and not, say, other members of the interim government or to anyone in any leadership role over there.  But I acknowledge the ambiguity.I think we're stuck.  English doesn't have a single clear, unambiguous phrase for the person in charge — it depends on when and where they're in charge.  If I had to choose between ``heads of state`` and ``heads of government``, I would choose the latter over the former every time, even if that meant listing leaders who, in their days, were not heading what we would now call a government.  .

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is the last time i will say, on behalf of this family IP, that we have not contributed to anything. Any further unfounded accusations of vandalism, and any further aggressive comments containing no information at all, i will report to a member of the wikipedia team. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI hope that if there are problems in the future, for example if someone else is using this IP externally, i would appreciate it if we could talk about it coherently, and once again request the courtesy of being informed of our Kafka-esque crimes.

But the ``Aria`` that you mention above is Greek for what is in Old Persian ``Haraiva`` which is modern Herat (Hari-Rud).

18695381;`NEWLINE_TOKENI find it just hilarious that a website that has an article dedicated to a topic such as this can't handle cussing. But hey, anything to divert attention away from the real issue. To me, the real issue is whether the article is made better or worse by an edit. And while SlimVirgin may have fixed a verb tense or two in his massive edit, the overall result, including the deletion of important embedded notes being replaced by unfounded questions of accuracy and urban legend, made the article far worse than it was. Several other problems have been listed as well. None of which, apparently are problems in SlimVirgin's mind. Apparently they all make the article better. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat we have is one massive diversion here. The article was made worse. But SlimVirgin can't admit it. Instead he will divert attention by saying his change was simply ``copyediting``, that I and another editor are trying to ``own`` this page, that it all comes down to editors like me inserting unsourced edits, that I'm POV, and finally that I swear too much.

I have not violated NPOV on the article. I have not attempted to own the page. I mounted a personal attack by calling you an explitive, but I won't apologize since it was in direct response to you completely distorting my words into something I would never say.

18928747;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Wrong again.  So far you have only based your claim on a web site.  Iranica does NOT say that Aryanem Vaejo is in Afghanistan, nor does Iranica say that any part of Afghanistan has ever been called Ariana.  If it does, paste the EXACT quote here WITH A LINK to that article.  The association of Afghanistan and ``Ariana`` for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines ``Ariana Airlines``.  You seem to be of the mindset that no matter what, nobody should change what you put in the articles. This is indicative of poor upbringing by your parents. Your parents have produced a foolish Mr. Know It All who is not smart enough to distinguish between the real world and the our-son-is-never-wrong environment of his mommy's house.  This is stupid.  I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong:NEWLINE_TOKEN:::1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of ``Iran Vij`` which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as ``Aria`` in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with ``Aryan`` and others picked it up.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called ``Ariana``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called ``Ariana`` or ``Aryana``.  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the ``official afghanis website says so`` you only show how weak your argument is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] ``the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan``  well, that is not good enough.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not the official website of Afghanistan.  What ``the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan`` is irrelevant here.  We are interested in correct information.  `;2840;1.0

19169720;`: FOR THE RECORD. Danny, you love to weave more straw men and avoid the real issues at all cost, as you have just beautifully demonstrated. As for me insulting you, it came because of you making provoking insults at me, calling me a `` hog and pig`` in one of your previous replies on 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC). If you were using that kind of language with members of the public in the street, you would no doubt be quickly punished and hospitalised for your insulting provocations, and you have also demonstrate why many Jehovah's Witnesses who follow your methods actually incite hate against themselves and their religion due to their shameless insulting and provoking behaviour. You then make more revealing and completely false remarks: ``As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are a logical fallacy. By the same token anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue``. I pointed out to you, that when I insulted you it did not prove your argumentation wrong (you prove yourself wrong by your manipulative specious methods and lack of any evidence), so therefore, it was not ad hominem at all, but just an insult from your own provoking insults of which you appear to measure by another set of biased scales. Secondly, all the points I have made about your false conclusions and your false logic are all valid as they prove that you are not objective or reasonable at all, and have zero evidence to base your claims on, and are often very slanderous of others (Raymond Franz in this case) with no evidence to back your claims.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:YOU Danny Muse, have failed to answer a single point of mine (a typical JW trait), which were about your logical fallacies, your use of slander, your negative propaganda, and your rhetoric. I have asked you again and again for proof of your statements and claims on Franz, and you have dramatically failed on all accounts to bring them on. Here again is the challenge summarized: I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is ``a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body`` as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated. . . your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on this matter. . .. If you can bring on proof, then you can have an opinion that the book descriptions are 'this or that' etc., until then all you say is biased POV and unfounded. You have no right to say or edit anything on this particular subject, as you have demonstrated that truth on the matter and literature is not a subject you are interested in. Please read Proverbs 18:13. Posted Central 19 July 2005 (PS. I'm sure you will ignore all this and make up some more straw man to focus on to take the light off your complete lack of evidential backup to your claims about the books and Raymond Franz's character etc. The original book descriptions should stay, as they are brief, to the point, accurate, and give enough information to know the basic book's content. If you disagree then prove it, don't vandalize out of spite as you have been doing.)Also, I see ''' checked the entire critical sections and made some edits on 18 June 2005, and approved the extended book descriptions, which you have totally ignored, therefore it was a yes vote, not a no)NEWLINE_TOKEN`;3171;1.0

20092141;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== film category cfds ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi - One way to read your notes at Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_July_28 (and I know you don't actually mean them this way) is that the anon votes are sockpuppets of .  Since this anon (whoever it is) didn't actually add the entries to CFD, I don't think it's inappropriate for him/her to vote.  And, if his/her ISP dynamically allocates IP addresses and the user want to remain anonymous, how would you expect him/her to vote?  Calling these ``sockpuppet`` votes seems a little overly confrontational.  Would you consider changing your note to be a little less insulting (assuming good faith)?  Perhaps something like ``user assumed to be the same as the user who originally added the cfd tag``?  IMO, accusing someone of being a sockpuppet is assuming some level of malicious intent, which I think is perhaps not warranted in this case.  BTW - in case you have any doubt, I assure you I am not the anon in question.     NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi, thanks for your message.  Actually, I had assumed good faith. I will change the notes on the ones that Kbdank71 ``added`` but the anon tagged.  The only reason I used the term ``sockpuppet``, is because if you actually read his votes, he insinuates that he is not the same person, yet they are all the exact same edits by each IP, along with the post on Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts stating he was not the same person.  I have tried to assume good faith, but he continued to remove Cfd tags, have categories requested to be speedied.  The only way I fealt the discussion could be fair, is if all were aware of the activities of the anon, although I'm sure most people realized it was the same.  Have a look at the log I created, if you haven't already .  I am not on a personal vendetta, I was in agreement with the anon about changing some of the cat's, but then it became ridiculous and we had to clean up all the bad-faith stuff that was done.  I will go change the way the comments read now.  Thanks again.   `;964;1.0

20253739;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== discussions ongoing to establish conventions in some eastern civilizations ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENhiNEWLINE_TOKENI observed that you have contributed to the discussion about article headings for Japanese monarchs and royals. It seems that these weeks, there are attempts to standardize such issues at several spots. One example is whether to standardize Thai royal persons. Of course, Thai and Japanese are totally different, for example regarding the need of disambiguation etc, and should probably be as separate as Eastern are in relation to european royalty naming. I think Japanese naming and Thai naming could end up to different conventions, and that is good if there are sufficient reasons for that. However, discussions may give new ideas and/or give reinforcement and more arguments for existing reasoning. Would you see the arguments and ``votes`` at: Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Thailand-related articles) and do you have any opinion?  `;1716;1.0

20362859;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Danny your motives are clearly not about being more ``encyclopaedic`` as we have seen your methods time and time again. As the Wikipedia page says: ``. . .You can quickly insert inline references to web pages by inserting a URL surrounded by single square brackets; this does not provide as much information to readers, but it is much better than not citing your sources at all`` Interestingly, I see you have only attacked and vandalized the Quotes website, and none of the Watchtower's multiple links, no surprise there with your gross bias screaming from the rooftops. As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975. You have failed to substantiate any of your claims about the quotes site; merely saying ``it's not useful`` is a deadpan POV with no basis but your own fear of reality, and your desperate urged to manipulate the public.

But you should be mindful that you've made a strong mess here, and no matter what your own opinon is, oyu should learn manners, and go out andd get a date rather than having your total amount of human interaction fed to you through wikipedia and your own websites.

The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against.

Terrible!!!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Why do you delete the number of ``Carson`` appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. - NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. - NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Greetings==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreetings and welcome to wikipedia.

21684416;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Fare Thee Weel, My Fine Friend! ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm back in town for a day and thought I'd drop by again.  I took a look at how your RFAr was coming along, as well as your evidence you are marshalling in your ``Sandbox`` at [].  I must say I am rather disappointed at the slight nature of said evidence.  Not that I'm going to be around, but I'm sure you don't have a very strong hand, as it were.  As I've said before, I've already explained the alternate accounts, and users Casito (and Soltak also to a smaller extent) have been just as uncivil to me as I had been to them.  Casito basically accused me of being a pedophile/stalker of some kind in his statement to the Arbitration Committee after all.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne thing that did seriously concern me and that I'd like to, if you please, elucidate, is that Casito's statement about ``website defacement`` being a ``crime`` in ``many jurisdictions`` is absolutely 100% misleading in our context.  First, there are no local jurisdictional issues here, the Internet is regulated at the national level in the U.S.  (I'm sure you knew that).  Second, like I told Casito, this is a Wiki, any changes on here, no matter how malicious, do not rise to the level of ``defacement,`` which pertains more to secure/static websites (think US Govt homepages for instance).  I don't know whether he realised this, but in practical terms what Casito said was misleading on both legal and practical grounds, a bluff if you will.

21684416;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Fare Thee Weel, My Fine Friend! ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm back in town for a day and thought I'd drop by again.  I took a look at how your RFAr was coming along, as well as your evidence you are marshalling in your ``Sandbox`` at [].  I must say I am rather disappointed at the slight nature of said evidence.  Not that I'm going to be around, but I'm sure you don't have a very strong hand, as it were.  As I've said before, I've already explained the alternate accounts, and users Casito (and Soltak also to a smaller extent) have been just as uncivil to me as I had been to them.  Casito basically accused me of being a pedophile/stalker of some kind in his statement to the Arbitration Committee after all.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne thing that did seriously concern me and that I'd like to, if you please, elucidate, is that Casito's statement about ``website defacement`` being a ``crime`` in ``many jurisdictions`` is absolutely 100% misleading in our context.  First, there are no local jurisdictional issues here, the Internet is regulated at the national level in the U.S.  (I'm sure you knew that).  Second, like I told Casito, this is a Wiki, any changes on here, no matter how malicious, do not rise to the level of ``defacement,`` which pertains more to secure/static websites (think US Govt homepages for instance).  I don't know whether he realised this, but in practical terms what Casito said was misleading on both legal and practical grounds, a bluff if you will.  Of course he didn't realise that I could see through his bluff, and when I calmly explained these two above points to him, he got really defensive and quite ``pissy,`` just as I'm sure he would in real life.

This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.NEWLINE_TOKENIt is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.NEWLINE_TOKENYBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.NEWLINE_TOKENYou will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of ``mass communication`` and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENI am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENI hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.NEWLINE_TOKENActually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNo need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENWhy so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?NEWLINE_TOKENThey were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENI consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J.

21982326;`COPY OF MAIL JUST SENT TO THE WIKIEN_I LISTNEWLINE_TOKENIn answer to the point of no legal threats - NEWLINE_TOKENThe legal reference was to the fact that I wasNEWLINE_TOKENbeing threatened with various forms of complaint thatNEWLINE_TOKENwould need defending against, by the AFF couple, atNEWLINE_TOKENthe same time as the block began, thus obstructing myNEWLINE_TOKENactions. I don't see that as a legal threat to sueNEWLINE_TOKENanyone. The point is one should not have personalNEWLINE_TOKENfeuds from outside Wikipedia brought into it, and ifNEWLINE_TOKENany harrassment that would be a wrong in the worldNEWLINE_TOKENoutside Wikipedia had been effected during the blockNEWLINE_TOKENwhich it had blocked me responding to, then thatNEWLINE_TOKENclearly would have been a legal wrong, becauseNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia can't opt out of the world. It is notNEWLINE_TOKENisolated from the existence of those factors inNEWLINE_TOKENsociety as a whole.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENe.g.in the argument about Nazism that's going on here,NEWLINE_TOKENyou are taking a position against having Nazis' targetNEWLINE_TOKENgroups put in danger, and you are doing that becauseNEWLINE_TOKENit's an outside world legal issue.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Wikipedia is not a democracy`` needs quite a sharpNEWLINE_TOKENanswer given to it. For the reason of keeping itselfNEWLINE_TOKENin passably right relationship with the outside world,NEWLINE_TOKENi.e.readers, Wikipedia holds a policy on neutrality ofNEWLINE_TOKENcontent. But the only way this policy genuinely existsNEWLINE_TOKENand is not a lie to readers, is if unconditionallyNEWLINE_TOKENanyone who falls victim to crowd psychology can layNEWLINE_TOKENclaim to by right, not have to beg for by favour, anyNEWLINE_TOKENmeasure that prevents a force of group numbers keepingNEWLINE_TOKENa bullying bias in place without having to find NPOVNEWLINE_TOKENground. Now, ``laying claim to`` anything, inherentlyNEWLINE_TOKENmeans being entitled to anything.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is actually a case-study in how society emergedNEWLINE_TOKENfrom the Middle Ages. To have any credible claim toNEWLINE_TOKENwork by any principles, a society must show theyNEWLINE_TOKENoperate reliably fairly, and to do that means thatNEWLINE_TOKENpeople are entitled to it. No way out of that. Hence,NEWLINE_TOKENas soon as any group tries to follow any policy codeNEWLINE_TOKENlike neutral POV, immediately people are entitled toNEWLINE_TOKENthings and all things are not dependent on favour. So,NEWLINE_TOKENit stands absolutely logically proved:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENeither * it's wrong to say to any user ever ``you'reNEWLINE_TOKENnot entitled to anything``,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENor * it's wrong to say to the public that Wikipedia has a neutrality policy that works.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThey can't both be right because anyone can see they contradict each other head-on. At least one must be wrong. Which is it?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENend of copy. Right, what this means is perfectly clear. Unless Wikipedia can answer the question I put there, ``which is it?``, then Wikipedia is illegal. It's as simple as that, and I'm immediately posting so in every single aspie forum I belong to. I will also be asking real-life organisations to file details on it as being part of a hate campaign. The illegality is shared by every person who does not leave Wikipedia. Unless - there is an unless - unless the question is answerable. There are only 2 answers: if it's the second answer, no neutrality policy, then Wikipedia would stand obliged by its own public admission to shut down, while if it's the first answer, the mob is not in charge and people are entitled to things, then this block ends. It's as simple as that.NEWLINE_TOKENNow, I have a right to challenge the block and this has been the challenge. The block forms part of a group-bullying hate campaign to establish that the mob is in charge, and if that is not the case, Wikipedia has absolutely firmly no other choice than to admit that people are entitled to things, and that inherently means it is not a ``legal threat`` to say so!!! That means being  entitled ''' to challenge any admin who claims it is. Now, people outside Wikipedia are going to see whether this has been passed on to every place for challenging blocks, and then what answers it gets. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`;3916;1.0
21985340;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI did not abuse and threaten - another user came there out of nowhere and started a crisis by making abusive personal attacks on me. I had to defend against them, to every person who refused to ignore them. It was not threatening to state the serious wrongs that would be committed if Wikipedia claimed to even have even in theory any discretionary choice not to take entirely my side as the victim in such a situation. The situation was an offence. Any organisation that decides to take offence at being told it does not have a discretionary choice to bully, is corrupt.

If you would like to experiment, use the sandbox. Thank you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENyours truly,NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===The others=== NEWLINE_TOKEN   |  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo prob.  Thanks for contacting me.  Believe me, I'd rather help you than block you.  So, here's some reading material:  Wikipedia:Manual of style.  This is an excellent resource for learning how to contribute here.  I'm also as close as my talk page.  Sorry to have come off harsh, but you wouldn't believe the sort of really weird edits from people who mean to harm the site instead of help it.  I'm extremely pleased to help you if you'd like. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWiki brah, why did you move a nomination for admin?  I'm not objecting, just confused.  Also, btw, how did you come across that page - it's not a usual page for new users to come across at first. Thanks in advance for your response.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Ho cakes==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUh, right.  )NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWB, what are you doing...?  I said I'd help you but if you do another edit like that last one, it'll be a time out.  OK?  No more weirdness?  Thanks. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWell, in order to stay, your articles really need to meet a certain level of quality.  I'm sure you mean well, but you really need to settle down a tad and get a feel for the site.  You can't treat this like a blog page.  ``Ho cakes?``  I admit, it made me laugh, especially the ``featured article`` header.  But...stuff like that really isn't the best use of the site's resources.  The nice folks who pay for the servers want the best possible return on their investment.  Tell you what:  I have to run, but if you have an idea for an article, why not stop by my talk page and let me know what it is?  Maybe if I show you how to write a good article, you might understand WIkipedia better. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt's OK.  We'll get you up to speed.  However, you should decide on a single user name.  Right now, you're bouncing between three of them.  How 'bout we just stick with this one here? -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Last warning.  If you continue to post nonsense, or to disrupt Wikipedia by slapping a delete template on Cindy Sheehan, you WILL be blocked.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENActually, that is exactly what I was coming here to do.  That was uncalled for as was ``Monkey spank.``  Gotta give you a time out for a couple of days for disrupting this site.  Nothing personal.  However, you can still edit this page if you wish to respond to the block. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Good Morning ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENso what are you doing and going on?  Why is everyone being mean to me?  I am just trying to help.  I read some guidelines and articles and don't think she is a notable person just like a stuntwoman on tv for brief fame.  I am getting better but still sort of autistic my parents still keep me here. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo one wants to be mean to you.  I had a feeling you were autistic and I'm working with a couple of other autistic users.  We welcome you here.  But, you need to remember that this isn't a playground and that you simply can't edit the way you have been.  I'm giving you one more chance.  I'll remove your block, but only if you do the right thing, OK?  Let us all help you. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOK, Brah.  I've unblocked you.  Now, please be good and edit like I know you can.  I have to go, but I'm keeping an eye on you.  )  Thanks. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi, WB.  Man, I'm glad it was you and not the vandal I'm dealing with right now who's messing up my page.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you want, I'll gladly paste that English-speaking template to your user page.  As far as making templates is concerned, they're pretty much like making articles, but I think you have to have the green light from other users before you create one.  I'll look into that for you.  Gotta run after I fix your user page. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Take a look==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThink you'll like your user page now.  ))  Later! -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Sarah==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWB, please do not post articles like that.  There isn't a problem with pornography here, but there is a problem with nonsense and near-nonsense.  OK?  Please? -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDigging your user page.  )  What I am referring to is the non-notability of ``Sarah.``  Can't you think of something to write about other than an unverifiable third-rate porn actress starring in a fourth-rate porn movie?  I admit, it made me laugh, though. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Copyright violation==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi, WB.  You cannot cut and paste information from other sites.  That's a violation of copyright law.  Not good.  Also, this is the English Wikipedia, not Brazilian Portuguese.  My friend, I don't want to send you for another time out, but this kind of editing is disruptive.  Let's wipe that thing out and start again, this time with a fresh article...one of your own. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Phil collins (south park) ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI didn't vandalize your article, I put it up for VFD for the reasons I stated there. And I'm glad that Lucky is working with you, he's a good guy. That doesn't have much to do with your Phil Collins article, however.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't have any opinion about you, I don't know you. You shouldn't take my motion to delete your article as any kind of personal attack. As they say, it's nothing personal, it's just business. And, on a different note, please stop plastering  and related templates on my talk page.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Templates ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWiki brah: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sorry, I'm working on about a dozen other things at the moment that I need to finish. I'd like to be able to help, but I have too many things going on all at once. I really don't know much about porn anyway, I'm a theology professor, and I usually stick to contributing to theology articles or doing admin actions. Perhaps some of the more porn-savvy contributors could be of help?   ·   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Concerns==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWB, do you realize that you just asked a Roman Catholic theologian - Essjay - for help with a porn article...?  And no, Soltak isn't picking on you.  He's trying to help but I think he's running short on patience.  I hate to say this, but so am I.  You keep on adding the same kinds of edits, you're using sockpuppets in an inappropriate manner (since when are you from Brazil, by the way?), you have yet to respond to a request for comment and now you're attacking other users.  I don't think you're being bad on purpose but your behavior's driving us kind of nuts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'd like you to do something for me.  Stay off Wikipedia this weekend.  That's not an order.  Instead, do something else.  Take a ride.  Go on a picnic.  Visit the park.  Go shopping.  Work on your hobbies.  Heck, watch some TV.  I plan on staying away myself.  I plan on spending time with my wife, flying my radio controlled airplanes and, quite possibly, start working on putting my 1965 Ford Mustang back on the street.  Poor little car's been sitting in my garage for six years and the weather should be pretty nice.  Might even tinker with my old '78 Mercedes-Benz 6.9 (that number sound familiar?).  In short, I'm going to do something that doesn't involve sitting by my computer.  You should too. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not being mean to you, WB.  If you really are originally from Brazil, I'm sorry I doubted you.  The ``request for comment`` means that several other users are worried about the kind of work you're making for others to clean up after you.  Soltak told you about it.  If you go to Wikipedia:Requests for comment, you'll see what I mean and you'll have a chance to respond.  Did you read my last note all the way through?  Did you have a chance to enjoy your weekend away from the computer?  I had a rough day myself.  Crashed my model airplane after putting time and money into it (my fault) and my car's alternator blew out, leving me stranded.  So, sadly, I am back on the computer for the time being.  Once again, no one is being mean to you but your edits are causing problems and we all want to help you contribute better.  Otherwise, you may be blocked from editing for good. -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy bad.  I was thinking of another user who has a request for comment posted.  It isn't you and I'm sorry to have concerned you.  As far as the new articles are concerned, they are much better in my opinion than the ones you've done.  The one on the SNL skit ;2507;1.0

22665526;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::If you're talking about the standard of joining gangs to overpower the bias of other gangs, I do not agree to that standard.  The standard I follow is simply to work with other editors to make each article a little better than we found it.  When a gang subverts that process by purposefully making articles worse as punishment or to serve a personal agenda, I tell them how I feel to their face.  Doing so is highly relevant to the article it affects and belongs in the discussion of that article.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I understand the concept of harmonious editing, and I agree with it as a priority second only to making sure that relevant information is not subverted.  Information is not an enemy of an honorable person, but we see influential people here at Wikipedia who do little more than strip pertinent data from articles or delete entire pages of unique and beneficial knowledge.  These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.  It's all within the rules of a system where there is no accountability for power, but it is in direct conflict to our humanity and what we know to be right.  I am in the position of having a strict set of personal morals that I have never had to compromise.  I feel that I have a lot to offer Wikipedia, but I'm certainly not going to defile the principles I've honored my entire life to be an editor here.  When I see corruption, I am going to speak up.

Inevitably, most parents will ask that the malfunctioning gay gene causing homosexuality will be corrected and homosexuality will be eliminated through this process.

Your selfishness in trying to destroy the hard work of others and their extensive debates on these matters is quite typical of many with your religious background (the blinkered view that any method is acceptable if it makes the JWs look good in the public eye). Censorship is not welcome here, especially when it has a blatant religious agenda and bias. You have failed to make a single point of valid criticism that has not been discussed at great length before (please go and read all 14 pages of talk) as you might start to understand why you are being so unreasonable and astoundingly narrow-minded. Wikipedia is here for factual information, not public relation promotions for religious sects; if you want that then go to the Watchtower's website. If you have a specific point with referenced proof and backup, then bring it here and discuss it, but please check it has not already been done before, and please don't come out with more nebulous vague accusation with no specific point or proof. If you have facts you feel are incorrect, then produce your documented proof with references, then it can be discussed here in a mature way, before any possible changes are made. Your current behaviour is highly offensive to all editors and contributors to Wikipedia. Regards.  20th of September, 2005NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN";123;1.0

I've tried everything possible to get the picture removed, and I've removed as many references as possible of anti-Baha'i sentiment. I've been called a Baha'i propagandist for all the stuff I've done. You can send whatever you want to Macau. Your edits have been disruptive, and I have a hunch you're not even a Baha'i. Once again, read the mountain of talk pages about the picture.

All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for WP:MUSIC, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, Wikipedia:Importance, Wikipedia:Notability (the fact that suicide girls, gidget gein, and marilyn manson are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance mainly the part stating ``There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)`` If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page.

Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -Willmcw NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. -Willmcw NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAny info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.Steve espinola NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreetingsNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreetings and welcome to wikipedia.

That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, ``Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade.`` Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.Steve espinola NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreetingsNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreetings and welcome to wikipedia.

NEWLINE_TOKENYou'd better not talk about objectivity, honesty, and so on, since you don't even know what this words mean. All of you actions are obviously driven by your interest in shutting down the publication of your dirty tricks. YBM NEWLINE_TOKEN- NEWLINE_TOKEN(...) call someone who entered the discussion for a week (LLL) or more than a year (Laurence) and didn't write even once, even a word about the scientific content of the affair or the Bogdanov's behaviour ? Another specific of this affair is that we have to deal with ``fans`` who don't care about science and don't even want to hear a word about the scientific incompetence nor the dishonest tricks Igor and Grichka Bogdanov have been proven to use on a daily basis for years. Just like rock stars, they have some (not much) fanatic bigots making as much noise as possible around anyone contesting their idols.

This guy's dishonesty is not a surprise for me, of course, but the fact that other people support him and that administrators let him act as he wants seems to me to be more serious than the fact that somebody like him exists. Laurence67  NEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKENI know this LLL, I correspond regularly with him! So you can think what you want, but he's not a sock puppet! But YOU want to believe it is just in order to feel free to revert him! Yes, he ``appeard``, because he saw that Igor was banned, that you were a lot more numerous than we are, and that according to the 3RR we can't revert more than 3 times per day. So it's easy for you, all you have to do is to take it in turns to revert systematically when we publish. Is it the wikidian neutrality? The majority ``wins``? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Sock puppets``NEWLINE_TOKENI confirm what Catherine (and even Snowspinner) have said: LLL is a ``real`` person, not a sock puppet.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMore generally, I find it is too easy to decide arbitrarily that any contributor who defends the Bogdanovs is a sock puppet, in order to have an excuse for reverting systematically his contributions, ``on sight``, as rbj has written. It is all the more unfair as he knows that the contributor is subject to the 3RR, while he thinks, rightly or wrongly, that he is not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBesides, I hope it's ``wrongly``: it would be the limit, if the rules were not the same for all contributors, and if some of these ones were protected from the sanctions at the expense of some others... Laurence67 NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBTW, XAL (or ``Sophie`` or whomever you are), I usually don't read your rantings (I responded to your post above that ended with the sweet ``let's work together as a team`` because it didn't sound like a rant), but this was pointed to me. NEWLINE_TOKENIn fact, I was blocked for 24 hours along with Igor by Ral315, for 3RR violation. but there is a difference: I submitted to the block, I didn't go unregistered and find another IP to post anyway, but Igor did not submit to it. he refused to abide by and posted to this talk page above ``Dear Marudubshinki...`` This suggests that Igor believes he is above the rules. the 3RR doesn't apply to him, does it? NEWLINE_TOKENthis reminds me of a time when i was a kid and we were saying ``table grace`` before our meal. my parents told us all that we had to be reverend, bow our heads, and close our eyes when we were praying our table prayer. well, i left mine open and so did my much younger brother and when the prayer was over, he immediately tattled on me saying to our parents that ``Bob didn't close his eyes for the prayer.`` geee, how did he know? NEWLINE_TOKENwell, it was Igor who made the complaint of the many reversions of mine and the admins decided (correctly) that he was reverting just as often as i was and the blocked us both. but since the rules don't apply to Igor, he went and posted (using IP address for instead of logging in to his account) anyway. it seems to me that the timing of this refusal to abide by his bl;1877;1.0

I didn't realize that the Bogdanov Affair affair had made it to RFAR; I just blocked XAL for the third time for unrepentant personal attacks. 72 hours. Should I unblock her so she can respond to this RFAR? I'd appreciate it if she could get an injunction against editing anywhere else, though (especially not on Talk:Bogdanov Affair), for what would have been the duration of the block. I'm not happy about all this vitriol she spreads, and, from past experience, I'd expect it to be worse now that I've gotten her worked up with a new block.

24748491;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article states that ``Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive``, but this is not true. They are exlusive acording to the constitution of Montenegro, the constitutional charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). On the other hand, it is true that a number of Serbs and Montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as ``Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive``. Many Montenegrins do not feel to be Serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. You can not force national groups to ``be Serb`` if they do not feel so and never declare as such.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``However the number of Montenegrins does seem to be in steep decline since the introduction of the category by the Communists on the 1948 census`` seems to imply that the Communist regime declared the nationality of citizens in polls. This is not true, as citizens declared their nationaility in polls, individually. In fact, the Communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as Montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. If it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the ``Serbian ruling dynasties in the pre World War II Yugoslavia banned Montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'Montenegrin'`` This is as true as the Communist quirp, as the Montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before World War II.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe statement ``over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that ``most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church``, but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that ``all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918.`` This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in ``its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church`` it is not balanced. Also, the statement ``its following is small to the point of non-existence`` needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers, or is this based on the fact that you are a believer of the SOC?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe sentence ``The validity of the referendum was not confirmed by international observers as the allegedly free and democratic vote, in fact took place during wartime in the former Yugoslavia.`` is true. So I leave it. Of course, I agree to change ``international`` into ``OSCE, EU and US`` - as the referendum may have had international monitoring from Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Byelorussia, and Russia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- user .`;3173;1.0

If an editor says ``some analysts believe``, it really means ``I don't know who believes it, but I want it in this article``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnfortunately, the current wiki has no way to decide ``truth`` and ``lies``.

There have been some movements to give weight to editors that are educated in one area more than those that are just shooting their mouths off, but they have failed.

25405629;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDefinitely his views contradict the current principles of Wikipedia. I don't think his intention is to comply with them. If no one expresses dissatisfaction and advocates change, there would be no improvement.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn the other hand there are users who are abusing the system covertly, like user Zoe and user Mikkalai. User Zoe is using Wikipedia to torture people by artificially finding fault in people's contributions. If she is not sufering from Sadistic Personality Disorder, why doesn't she make contributions herself? What's there in it for her? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUser Mikkalai's point of view is not neutral. User Mikkalai from Belarussia (an area notorious for right wing tendencies) who is behind the current edition of the Intelligentsia article seems to have a political has reconstructionist, zarist, and nationalistic bias and his edits distort the truth through omission, taking things out of context, and other tools of propoganda. For some reason he stops on pre-revolution Russia, as if there was no further developments after that? Is that neutral?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe important role intelligentsia played during the Soviet epoch (70 years of history) is understated if not absent from the article. There is no explanation of the role Jewish intelligents played in the revolution, and why many Jewish intelligents joined the revolution (pogroms and cherta osedlosti) is not mentioned. He is quoting Lenin as calling Intelligents ``the shit of the nation``, while he does not mention that Lenin and Trotsky were intelligents themselves. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe attribute of a cosmopolitan is not mentioned either, obviously because it is associated with Jews. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHe listed for deletion about Abram Kamensky, under the pretext of not being notable enough to be in Wikipedia. Abram Kamensky was mentioned in Russian Jewish Encyclopedia, which is a printed encyclopedia compiled by international experts. How is it that this person is not notable enough to be mentioned in an online encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone? NEWLINE_TOKENThis person was mentioned in a Solzhenitsin's novel, he was a deputy minister of the ministry of national affairs, one of the first people to join the bolshevik party, as mentioned in the debate involved in the founding of the short-lived Donetsko-Krivorogian Soviet Republic,  father of a well-known russian art critic. This is enough to make him notable. The reason he was demoted to a lower post was because he was briefly a member of the Trostkyst opposition, which Stalin didn't forgive him for. At any rate, the argument that he was somewhat obscure by the time of his death does not hold water, because many people who were famous died in obscurity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe point is, user Mikkalai from Belorussia does not possess a thorough enough knowledge of Soviet history to make that judgement. The reason he listed the article for deletion was personal and political bias. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI thought the purpose of Wikipedia was so people could add research and facts to someone's start-up. Not to list every start-up that is perhaps not well researched enough for deletion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUser Mikkalai even listed Aleksander Kamensky article for deletion for reason of non-notability  one of the most well known art crtitics in later twentieth century Russia, and an internationally recognized expert on Marc Chagall, whose book Marc Chagall, The Russian Years was an international best-seller, and was postthamously reprinted and presented at the Tretiakov gallery with Marc Chagall's granddaughters in attendance. What do you think, this guy knows what he is talking about?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHe has vandalized Aleksander Kamensky article. He took out Kamensky's definition of the stern style that was one of the three quotes from one of his books, translated personally by LevKamensky for the article. While in the articles discussion page he requested stern style to be defined. This shows that he deleted it without even reading it. If that is not vandalism, than what is? This is a wolf in sheeps clothing. I suggest reverting the article to LevKamensky's last edition and blocking it from further editing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipidia articles are always on the first page when you make a search on Google, or another search engine. This makes Wikipidia a very influential tool in swaying public opinion. Many people complain that Americans are dumb, and they don’t know basic facts, or that they are shallow. Well now with the internet, they are becoming more aware, but don’t leave them in the hands of half-illiterate graduate students, or right wing fanatics.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy was the Russian Intelligentsia category deleted, that LevKamensky created, that contained some three dozen brightest minds in Russian culture of the XX century? Why does the Russian social groups category contain cosacs and peasants but not intellectuals? We think this is more political than neutral. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo stop using Wikipedia as a political soapbox. At least LevKamensky is open about his opinions, he is not manipulative like these charachters.`;3310;1.0

It is true that many well-known people are strogly attacked, and it is also true that many eventually widely acccepted scientific ideas are considered absurd and crankish early in their history.

Given that Firefly is proving to be a failure at the box office by the well accepted formula of Movie Cost > Box Office Take, I am suggesting we start formulating a way to add that to the article.  I mention my love of the movie only to avoid the fans who might try to POV push because they don't want to face the awful truth.  I would suggest you take more time to help with the discussion on what should be said here, rather than pull out an unneeded and rather silly soap box.  We are talking about sourceable information Jeff, you just are not listening.  Additional to say we can't mention our like or dislike of the film seems to suggest you think personal opinion can't be expressed on Wikipedia Talk pages.  Well it can be expressed and it should be expressed.  We all have natural bias, by talking about our opinions we help others to identify our bias making it easier to critique our additions.  Furthermore, Wikipedia is a community, and we're having fun.  I'm sorry you can't seem to handle that.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Now, what I'm trying to say is that we need to stop POV pushing on the article.

I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENShe has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPerhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe BUAV is not a ``controversial organisation``. It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become ``controversial`` just because you don't share it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENthus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ``agreed`` to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOnce I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBoth of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a ``copyviolater`` trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn't understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn't handle disagreement well. So perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? I know it's hard. I find the establishment hard to deal with sometimes. They tend to say ``Wikipedia thinks this...`` when they mean ``My friends think this...`` They forget the diversity and multiplicity of opinion that exists here and live in an echo chamber because they know they are empowered and do not need to pay any attention to that diversity to get what they want.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENfyi, 70% of her images are tagged as fair use without providing a single rationale (few of them fall under the subcategories like stamp, logo etc. where it's easy to understand).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes. But as I noted, plain common sense would direct you to understand that fair use is being made of the photos. They are the product of a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to educate people about animal torture. Having their material illustrate an encyclopaedia article about animal torture would clearly suit their purpose, as Slim pointed out to you, I believe. Ignoring that makes your approach seem malicious. I think Slim is in part bewildered by your making such a huge, urgent issue out of it, when the chances of legal dispute are so very small. So perhaps we could agree that Slim should provide rationales in due course, and preferably have the photos released under a suitable licence, but in the meantime there's no particular urgency to re-tag them or to insist on rapid action? Surely a commitment to act would be sufficient.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENShe also keeps reverting to her tags, violating all admin rules. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat's another issue. I think Slim is one of many admins who would be better off not having the powers, because they lead her into disputes of this nature, where the issue all too rapidly becomes her and not her edits, which is unfortunate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs it stands I'm erring on the side of caution, while Slim wants to stretch the boundry of ``fair use``. Tx 4 ur interest in this.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN''I agree that you're being very cautious, and I think caution is right, as I noted. However, I think in the case of the BUAV images in particular that they are clearly ``fairly used``. You have to ignore their provenance to think otherwise. I can see from your discussion with her that Slim was not very successful in communicating her point of view, because she interpreted legitimate concern over copyright for a personal attack, largely because, I think, you didn't take into account the source of the photos and their likely reaction to their being in WP. Still, I do agree that she should ask for confirmation from BUAV that they are cool with our using the photos; but I think you should lay off them (and her) so long as she has made the commitment to acquire that confirmation.

You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary.

While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have ``agreed`` to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith.

Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom.

They are the product of a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to educate people about animal torture.

26335756;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWell, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.`` Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMuslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFunny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2;2002;1.0

The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFunny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2;740;1.0

27344507;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Wikipedia's ethics towards you==NEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia has no policies, applied consistently. All the admins on en-l openly admit counting any shred of persanal fairness as mattering less than developing Wikipedia as they wish. Blocking of only 1 side when 2 sides have done exactly the same thing that the block is supposed to have been for, is routine. It's what happened to me too, and claiming to have any rights against a biased 2-day block actually was the offence that got me permablocked, after only 5 weeks' membership. NEWLINE_TOKENLook at all these: a voice from within Wikipedia's own system describes how the ArbCom and dispute resolution systems are rigged with discretionary catch-alls that always enable admin to win http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-June/024230.html on how force of group numbers dictates Wikipedia pages's content http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025936.html this is actually called ``don't bother reporting abusive admins`` http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025921.html I was wary of how the umpiring of pages the whole world can fight over could possibly work well, but I was drawn into Wikipedia by a friend who was briefly (and no longer is, already!) having good experiences with sharing his medical concerns on a couple of pages on medical subjects. Here are 2 administrators saying to me http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-August/027816.html http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-August/027817.html saying ``You are not entitled to anything`` and ``Wikipedia is not a democracy.`` NEWLINE_TOKENOn the nature of Wikipedia: NEWLINE_TOKENhttp://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025583.html http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/08/322087.html http://spectrum-fairness.blog.co.uk/ tag ``Wikipedia`` NEWLINE_TOKENmessages of support: NEWLINE_TOKEN``some of the people on there do seem pretty sarcastic and bullying .... some of the right-wingers on there seem to think mentioning anything negative but factual about Reagan or Bush constitutes bias and there do seem to be some nasty characters on there.`` - from Aspievision, http://s13.invisionfree.com/aspievision/index.php NEWLINE_TOKEN``You are not the only one who has had problems with Wikipedia taking sides in a dispute, and being blatantly unfair to the other side without even giving them a chance to defend themselves.`` from FAMSecretSociety, a Yahoo group `` NEWLINE_TOKENof late I've noticed that some independent contributions have been either radically edited or censored. I've not had time to check articles on 9/11, the London Bombings, the assault on Falluja etc, but judging from the way content was edited promptly out of articles on SSRIs, schizophrenia and Asperger's, there definitely seem to be operatives in place ready to clamp down on anything that may cast doubt on establishment canards.`` from Medialens, http://www.medialens.org/board/`;515;1.0

It sounds bad/evil, but it's better than what I ended up seeing: people were quoting the old Tekken (2006 film) as gospel saying it's cast list or storyline was accurate, etc. People were citing Wikipedia as a source elsewhere.

28995854;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN    Oh, now you're comparing the legendary Phil Hellmuth to a pint of rocky rhode ice cream?      What has this discussion degraded into.  Different people have different tastes, but Hellmuth's television appeal can be statistically proven.  Perhaps ``popular television`` would be more accurate, but the phrase ``great television`` is understood to mean just that.  ``Ice cream tastes great`` is not analagous because the verb 'tastes' serves as a link between the noun 'ice cream' and the adjective 'great' implying that ice cream is objectively great.  This would be a foolish leap and it would violate Wikipedia's NPOV policy.  Please keep this dialogue on topic and refrain from such faulty analogs.  The subject matter of this discussion is Phil Hellmuth, not ice cream or your aversion to personal attack.NEWLINE_TOKEN    Let's let others chime in on this topic and come to a clear consensus.  Hellmuth's television appeal is an integral part of his notoriety, and excluding it simply because one user deems it to opinioniated would do a terrible injustice to his page and a disservice to the Wikipedia community.

The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.``NEWLINE_TOKENhttp://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGovernment schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMost comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their ``Nationalist`` and ``New Nation`` magazines, the ``Nationalist Educational Association`` and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their ``Nationalism`` clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book ``Looking Backward`` was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the ``Nationalist`` magazine, and he preached what he called ``military socialism.``  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the ``Wholecaust`` (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  It was so bad that Holocaust Museums could quadruple in size with Wholecaust Museums to document the entire slaughter.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome schools in the USA are still named after Francis Bellamy.  The Bellamy schools should be re-named because they send the wrong message to children and the community.  It causes emotional distress to children who attend schools named after a man who popularized the Nazi salute and who helped the government institutionalize racism and segregation.  I, and my supporters, will also assist in any legal means to defray the cost of re-naming Bellamy schools.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf government's schools (and the media) told the true history of the Pledge, then no student would chant it. If Americans knew the truth, then the Pledge would cease to exist.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFight the flag hags and their flag fetish. Government's schools should not teach kids to verbally fellate flags each morning. It is like a brainwashed cult of the omnipotent state. For adults it is childish. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENListen to audio exposing the flag and the Pledge http://rexcurry.net/rexcurry4.mp3NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN              *********************NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs an attorney, I am asked if students can be forced to say the Pledge of Allegiance in government schools.  Another school year has started, and it is important to educate children about their right to refuse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGovernment schools deserve a failing grade for not teaching students about their right to refuse and about the horrid history of the Pledge. There are still some oddball states where government schools are required by law to begin each day with a robotic chant of the Pledge, after students hear the ringing of a bell, like Pavlov's lapdogs of the state.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGovernment schools in the U.S. were the origin of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis) because the Pledge's original salute was a straight-armed salute.   It is a myth that the salute is an old Roman salute. Most students never see the eye-popping historic photographs. http://www.rexcurry.net/pledge2.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI became involved in litigation about the Pledge of Allegiance before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Wonschik v. United States  http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/03-10249.htm  Research in that case and other litigation involving the Pledge, led to astounding discoveries concerning the Pledge's past.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe history of the Pledge is suppressed because it is unlibertarian.  The Pledge was written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, a self-proclaimed National Socialist, who wanted a government takeover of education to produce an ``industrial army`` (a Bellamy term) for the authoritarian vision in his cousin Edward Bellamy's book ``Looking Backward.`` The Bellamy cousins promoted national socialism worldwide for decades. It resulted in racist and segregated government schools that lasted through WWII into the 1960's, setting a horrid example for hate-spewing groups worldwide. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA webpage helps students learn that the Pledge was written by a National Socialist and the rest of the Pledge's truly terrifying history:NEWLINE_TOKENhttp://www.rexcurry.net/stopthepledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe eye-popping new version of the popular graphic art ``All in favor of gun control raise your right hand`` is at http://www.rexcurry.net/pledgewonschik.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENIn the new version, the original Nazi-style salute to the U.S. flag is exposed with the phrase: ``All in favor of a Pledge of Allegiance raise your right hand.``NEWLINE_TOKENThe graphic art shows the original Pledge of Allegiance on the left and on the right it shows the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party.NEWLINE_TOKENIt explains that the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S. flag is the origin of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the 1930s, the National Socialist German Workers' Party passed laws that required everyone to pledge allegiance, similar to many state laws in the U.S. that have tried to require school-children to recite the Pledge. Jehovah's Witnesses believed that people who enjoy reciting government pledges are people who worship government. Jehovah's Witnesses were officially banned in Germany for refusing to join the raised palm salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party in schools and at public events. Many of the German Witnesses were imprisoned in concentration camps.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe National Socialist German Workers' Party had adopted the U.S. salute and forced people to perform it.  Many states in the U.S. had a practice similar to that of  National Socialist German Workers' Party in forcing people to perform the salute created by a National Socialist in the U.S.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the 1940's, before the phrase ``under God`` was added to the Pledge of Allegiance, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to recite the Pledge in school on";1582;1.0

29462760;"`Thomas PynchonNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Crying of Lot 49NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENONE summer afternoon Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (``Mucho``) Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. ``Pierce, please,`` she'd managed to get in, ``I thought we had``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``But Margo,`` earnestly, ``I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,`` or something.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``For God's sake,`` she said. Mucho had rolled over and was looking at her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Why don't you hang up on him,`` Mucho suggested, sensibly.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I heard that,`` Pierce said. ``I think it's time Wendell Maas had a little visit from The Shadow.`` Silence, positive and thorough, fell. So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down. She had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, didn't know how to tell the law firm in L. A. that she didn't know where to begin.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Mucho, baby,`` she cried, in an access of helplessness.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMucho Maas, home, bounded through the screen door. ``Today was another defeat,`` he began.NEWLINE_TOKENNEW";3739;1.0

29629022;"` 2005 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I essentially replaced the wording, eliminating ``most`` from ``most widely.`` Jayjg reverted, but I'm going to put it in again absent a good argument against doing this. Maimonides' version clearly is widely used  Wikipedia's own article on the 613 mitzvot includes Maimonides' list as its only example, and describes Maimonides' work that included the list as ``The most important of the above works`` from a list of works that include versions of the list. It is also the only version that I have seen reproduced anywhere online. While Jay claims that the absence of aliyah from Maimonides' list should not be mentioned because virtually every other list includes it, that is not logical if Maimonides' list is ``the most important`` of the lists; it is essentially original research for Jay to conclude that the singularity of the absence of aliyah to Maimonides' list makes it not worth mentioning.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm sure it is true that others of Maimonides' writings indicate what Jay alleges, but the text from the article refers particularly to the 613 commandments. It would make sense (in fact, when I replace the wording, I'll do it myself) to note that Maimonides' other writings tend to contradict the omission, but that does not necessarily nor, I think, in fact warrant suppressing the note about the ``most important`` of the mitzvot lists being the exception to the statement in the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Jay describes the clarification as ``uncited POV,`` which may be true regarding ``most widely,`` which I eliminated, but not ``widely,`` nor anything else about the clarification. It is also highly selective, clearly, not to note that the exception to including aliyah in the mitzvot comes from perhaps the most important of the versions.NEWLINE_TOKEN: 21:52, 29 November`";2613;1.0

29693632; November 2005 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Fat is never converted to Glc, not at least in humans according to the textbooks.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Let me add few things. First, Glc enters/leaves the cell through a proces called facilitated diffusion. Which means that as soon as the Glc concentration inside the cell is somehow increased, Glc will start leaving the cell - which by the way happens in hepatocytes during glycogenolysis. Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30;2512;1.0

Their abuse of sources shows their willingness to subscribe to editing and rules, in the face of facts and researched knowledge. They are pedantic and callous, and I unfortunately have joined them at their own level; I must now re-elevate myself and return to the dictates of logic and critical thinking, something that my experience on Wikipedia has deluted. I will return to my original research and take the experience of Wikipedia as a lesson; that no matter how much experience and involvement a person has on a particular subject, there are always those who no nothing, willing to reduce your efforts to elevate their own egos and ambitions.

NEWLINE_TOKEN::See it for yourself: Green bars are for edit summaries, red bars are for edits with no summaries.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::That's quite a nifty tool there. I'm fully aware of edit summaries. I don't provide edit summaries on my own talk page, or my User Page. I also don't usually provide them on other users' talk pages. In earlier editing, I didn't take the summary seriously; if you're referring to anything from several months ago or more, I do apologize. Like I said: if you have any particular situations where you believe I missed one, please bring them up to me. I would sincerely like to know. Otherwise, I don't see what you're trying to accomplish here.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::I think the link speaks for itself.  As for what I'm trying to accomplish, I think my original comment explained just that.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::If you were trying to just helpfully remind me, I thank you, though I don't think it was needed. I saw the page; it didn't say anything to me, except that I finally know my edit count. If you really want to get a point across to me, I suggest you do so blatantly. If your original comment explained your motives, then we are done here.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Your ``nonsense`` page ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you are interested in archiving your old talk, you may want to review Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page.  Accusing other editors of ``defacing`` your talk page for politely reminding you of Wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part, and will only make you look bad.  I suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like .  Furthermore, making negative comments about discussion by other editors, and claiming that their edits ``are not worth reading`` shows that you aren't interested in abiding by  WP:NPA, WP:CIV, nor WP:EQ.  If you want to improve your working relationship with other editors, it might help to avoid incivility.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet, but thank you for the suggestion. I use ``nonsense`` in a lot of ways other people do not, because I find a lot of other words to be boring at present. Likewise,  instead of ``cool,`` or ``awesome,`` or ``that's interesting,`` I'm currently in the habit of referring to things as ``nifty.`` It's something I do. I know how to archive a talk page, I've done it before. I still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack, because I've grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere. I'm not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words. I thought that this was resolved by now. I have quite decent relationships with other working editors; it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along. It is regretful, but something which seems to be. If someone takes offence to my creation of a Nonsense page, they can bring it up to me personally, as you have done, and I will explain. That's another thing that I do. My other option would be to straight-out delete your ``reminders of policy,`` just like another particular user has done with mine in the past. I think you know why I don't do that. When all is said and done, it's my talk page, and I'll do what I like with it.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::I think you have avoided my point.  Other editors (including myself) may perceive your comments as petty attacks. Your response seems to show that you just don't care about civility or treating other editors with a modicum of respect.  The edits in question most certainly did not ``deface`` your talk page, nor could they be considered nonsense in the true definition of the word.  Describing the discussion as ``worthless`` comes close to violating the spirit of WP:NPA.  While I don't think you are directly making a serious personal attack in this instance, you cannot use your talk page to attack other editors.  Again, please read WP:CIV.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I have not avoided your point. Other editors may percieve all they wish, but if they're not willing to bring it up to me, then it isn't serious enough to be dealt with. Generally, I don't retain high levels of respect for people who simply percieve without making sure of things. I believe I explained the labelling of ``nonsense``  it's akin to miscellaneous in its current usage on this page. Language is a living, fluid thing; especially where I come from, you can't tie things down to set defenitions  it's all about context. I didn't say that the content of the page was worthless  simply that it was probably not worth reading, since it is irrelevant by now, and probably doesn't have anything to do with the reader. I still do not view anything on that page as a reminder of policy. I view this as a better solution than ``Strike offensive words or replace them with milder ones on talk pages`` as suggested by WP:CIV. I have left all words undifferenced, and simply moved them to a place where I do not have to see them when I'm looking for a new message. They simply aren't serving any purpose for me. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::My talk page essentially serves as a tool for others to leave me messages, whatever they may be. It's much easier for me to not only get the messages faster, but to respond to them civilly and cooly if I do not have to review certain discussions that do naught but aggrivate me.  `";2506;1.0

This is the only username I have ever edited Wikipedia under. A long time ago, before this account was created, I edited as my IP for a few edits, that were entirely grammatical. A bunch of users have come into this article without making accounts, simply using their IPs. I wish to proclaim, to everyone, in all sincerity, that I am in no way connected to any of them. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for any alleged ``Meatpuppet Campaign,`` yes, I made posts on LiveJournal asking for people to come over and review the article. I invite everyone to review the posts.  conveniently gone through the trouble of tracking them down, and they are available in the RfC he's preparing agaisnt me. Several LJ Users voiced distress, and I offered advice. This happens all the time in Wikipedia's IRC channel. This is far from an organized campaign, and I dispute the claim firmly. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm do not know where all of these IP users came from. In the event that they did come from LiveJournal, I have edited the LJ posts I made, asking any users who came to Wikipedia to read through an introduction to Wikipedia, and to create an account. I also put emphasis against Personal attacks. I can't do anything more about it. If you feel this is untrue, then please, please, bring it up to me, before your decide to take up other peoples' time with the issue. I know I make mistakes, and I try to fix them when I can. I like people to tell me when they think I make them, as obviously, I don't realize all of them. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPersonal Attacks: I called  ``ignorant.`` In the atmosphere I've developed in, that's not anything close to an attack. I do apologize if anyone took offense to it, as they seem to have. I came out of the exchange feeling attacked as well. We seem to have had a cultural misunderstanding. I'll refrain from the practice of using that word as such in this environment (on Wikipedia). This is the only personal attack I remember anyone bringing to me. If you have others, please tell me. Otherwise, please stop saying that I am attacking anyone. It was an isolated incident, and we both seem to have gotten over it. Why can't you? Stop bringing it up. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDuring the time I was gone, a bunch of anonymous users seem to have popped up here. However, none popped up at any of the other articles I am concerned with (Scottish Clans; view my contributions if you're interested). I refute any claims that are made to connect me with these users.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI in no way endorse the attacks that were made upon anyone in my absence, or any attacks for that matter. I want to make that clear, and final. If you have something against me, then be honest. Please. It's all I can ask of you. I want to work things out. I suggest everyone who wishes to contribute to the process of creating an encyclopedic article out of Veganism read through Intercultural communication principles.  `";403;1.0

The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is ``covered up`` by people and also people often refer to it as the ``Nazi-Soviet`` pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand ``Nazi`` and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as ``Nazis`` (they did not refer to themselves as ``Nazis``).  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as ``It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!``  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word ``Nazi`` to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase ``National Socialist.`` The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand ``Nazi`` even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment ``Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!``   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name ``Union of Soviet Socialist Republics`` and also used the term ``Communist`` instead of using the term ``Socialist.``  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired ``Nationalism`` clubs worldwide including in Germany. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN    Yes, the ``Roman salute`` page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term ``conspiracy.`` It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who ``became wiser``, by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as ``S`` shapes standing for its ``Socialism`` is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberately covered up the discovery (as the writer above admits) and have excluded it from the Swastika article.  The writer above simply made up his denial and he knows that Dr. Curry is correct and he shows it because he does not dispute a word of it and can give no opposing citations or reference.

31561411;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== read the truth at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_saluteNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is ``covered up`` by people and also people often refer to it as the ``Nazi-Soviet`` pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand ``Nazi`` and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as ``Nazis`` (they did not refer to themselves as ``Nazis``).  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as ``It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!``  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word ``Nazi`` to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase ``National Socialist.`` The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand ``Nazi`` even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment ``Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture.

An earlier version referenced the work of Professor Rex Curry and started thusly: ``The Roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight, with palms down. Sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle, sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. The salute was supposed to have been used in the Roman republic, but there is no clear evidence of this. Indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in Roman culture`` (by Paul Barlow).  A more recent version of the same article is written as if a neo-Nazi has been covering-up again.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase ``Roman salute`` and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of Dr. Curry, conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the Roman Republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in Roman culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the ``Roman Salute`` concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted Roman images in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the ``Roman Salute`` concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry's discoveries.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, there is no evidence that Jacques-Louis David actually thought that his painting ``The Oath of the Horatii`` represented an actual historical Roman salute.  All of the evidence indicates that David created the scene out of whole cloth for drama. All of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk. The intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by Dr. Curry http://rexcurry.net/pledgehoratii.html  Further, the Horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Tennis Court Oath was painted by David later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in a more modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed. David was not there. Further, the oath was was written on paper (the paper being read by the central figure?) and the ``oath was taken`` by signing the document. There is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting (the central figure might be swearing, or he might be reading his document) while those people about him waive hats, talk, holler, point, etc.  Three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the Horatii painting.  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe distribution of the Eagle Standards was painted by David even later, and repeats David's use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in another modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all.  The wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings.  That painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oath-taking or at all and simply shows various people, with various gestures, acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for, and shouting for, the ``Eagle Standards.``  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe wiki writer then claims that other painters during the nineteenth century regularly depicted the straight-arm gesture in scenes of Roman imperial history.  The writer cites no support because there is no support.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is no support for the idea that the ``Roman Salute`` concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry's shocking discoveries about the salute's origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misrepresented neoclassical art to cover-up Professor Curry's discoveries.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe cover-up is also supported by the fact that wiki writers know (or should know) that Francis Bellamy explained the origin of his salute and that it had nothing to do with imitating any painting, nor imitating any ``Roman`` salute myth.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt this paragraph the intellectual dishonesty doubles.  The writer is attempting to imply that there is a relationship between the original Pledge salute and the myth of the ``Roman salute.``  No support is cited because there is no support. The writer is not honest enough to clearly state that the supposed Roman myth was not an influence upon Francis Bellamy or Bellamy's cohorts. The writer will not reference Dr. Curry's clear explanation of how the Pledge salute was selected by Bellamy and Bellamy's cohorts, which is known because Bellamy explained its creation.  The writer knows that it does not support the myth that the writer is trying to perpetuate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe writer will not mention Professor Curry's voluminous dissection of Bellamy's love of the military and the Bellamy term ``military socialism.``  The writer is still covering-up for socialism. The writer is also completely evading the fact that the use of the military salute in the Pledge evolved into the classic hard stylized Nazi salute.  The writer is evading the fact that the Nazi salute is an extended military salute, via the Pledge of Allegiance. All of those are discoveries by Professor Curry.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is unclear because the writer has knowingly refused to acknowledge Dr. Curry's discovery that the use of the military salute by Bellamy, caused the extended arm salute to change in use.  Wikipedia articles are so intellectually dishonest that they are comical.  It had nothing to do with the ``Roman salute`` myth, but the writer cannot bear to give up his distortions.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Wikipedia writer implies that the Olympic salute came from a classical painting, but the wiki writer knows that he has no support to cite.  The wiki writer is aware of Dr. Curry's voluminous and ground-breaking work exposing the Olympic salute but the writer is too intellectually dishonest to even mention it. http://rexcurry.net/bookchapter1a1c.html   The writer evades Professor Curry's explanation that the Olympic salute also derived ultimately from the Pledge of Allegiance.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe wiki writer references how Dr. Curry exposed the work of Martin Winkler regarding the use of the Roman salute in films. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Martin Winkler, while discussing the old films, was unaware that the salute had been the original salute of the Pledge of Allegiance. Dr. Curry long ago challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues in public and Dr. Curry has maintained that standing debate challenge, which has been met with complete silence. http://rexcurry.net/pledge-professor-martin-winkler.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe wiki writer adopts Martin Winkler's intellectually dishonest use of the term ``fascist`` to further aid the wiki writer in covering-up for the National Socialist German Workers' Party and for the National Socialism of the Bellamys.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe wiki writer also mentions a chest variation of the salute but the writer is too intellectually dishonest to mention Dr. Curry's photographs and explanation that the same variation was used earlier in the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S. flag.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFranklin Delano Roosevelt did not institute the hand-over-the-heart, and the writer acknowledges the error in the next sentence when referencing the act by Congress.NEWLINE_TOKENThe writer fails to mention that through most of Roosevelt's time in office the straight arm salute was used and Professor Curry possesses photographic examples of Roosevelt himself being saluted with the notorious salute. It is interesting to note that Congress did not inject itself into the mess until after the U.S. entered World War II, December 7, 1941.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article uses four (or more) forms of the word ``Nazi`` and never gives the actual correct name of the horrid party: the National Socialist German Workers' Party.

Dominick is a ``POV Warrior`` with a a neo-conservative Catholic POV who engages in harrassment and a soft form of ``vandalism`` (though I don't think his purpose is to imperil the integrity of the encyclopedia, he is removing perfectly good content for no good reason  and lying about that content in the process). If he wants to go through and put the line ``a traditional Catholic website`` after any link to my site, then fine. But removing the links, replacing them (esp. with lesser quality links), lying about them (he says they're a ``blog,`` ``POV,`` ``monograph,`` 'linkspam,`` etc.), slandering me and the site in his edit summary notes, etc.  I can't just let him do that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you can give me decent odds that I will get a fair ``hearing,`` if the abritrators will read my RfC and the associated discussion page, click on the links, and look into what I have been saying, then I would very much like to move forward; but, if the odds say it's going to be a matter of their looking at style over substance (e.g., seeing my admitted sarcasm after months of weirdness and not looking into the reasons for it), then , I dunno 'cause I can't take another ``Oh, great, he wins again!`` type situation.

The French report includes several religions and organizations that are also English (American) organizations  yet in the Wiki articles about them, they are not referred to as ``cults,`` nor is the French report cited in relation to them.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, the following organizations and religions are included in the French report: Mormons, Jehovah's Witness (reference to the term in the title of a source cited here, but it is not stated in the text of the article as it has been in this one) Seventh Day Adventists (``cultic`` as defined by the author of a cited book on the subject, and it has its own specific meaning - see article on Cults), the Church of God, Transcendental Meditation, the Humanist Party movement, the Church of Christ, Scientist, Pentacostals, and Raja Yoga.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf we are striving for NPOV, then the term ought to be applied equally and objectively to all entries that are also cited in this same report, OR, the report and reference outght NOT to be cited or used in this particular article, OR a different citation ought to be used in which the definition of the term is stated clearly, and/or make it clear that the French article is speaking of the SGI France specifically, (in which case, it would probably only be fair to also find similar reports about each and every SGI organization and see how each country views the organization in its country. And that would be ridiculous. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOtherwise, the only remaining reason for its inclusion in this article and not in others, is because some editors hold a POV about SGI, (as noted in Wiki's article on the subject). That is not appropriate, and NPOV. - Ruby  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Hi Ruby. I thought we'd lost you there!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I think the cult reference is touchy. And for the record: personally, I think it should be noted in articles on other religious groups when they have been plausibly accused of cult-like activities. Also, everyone might want to note that the French government's usage of ``cult`` is clearly and finely defined: a group has to meet certain objective criteria to be listed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:As for our article here, please remember that it is not saying that SGI is a cult, it's saying that SGI has been accused of being a cult. That the French government listed it as such is an undeniable fact, and it's something that people looking up SGI should know. I believe that the French government has rescinded this listing, which is something you might want to look into; but nonetheless, credible media in several countries and localities—in the US, particularly southern California—have also described SGI as a cult or being ``cult-like`` (e.g., Die Zeit'', one of Germany's leading newspapers). Almost every website on cults  (even when it's not run by some disgruntled SGI member) also has a section on Soka Gakkai or SGI, so denying or trying to avoid mention of the cult accusations is, I would think, likely to work against SGI: it looks like cover-up, and perfectly reasonable people are likely to interpret that as evidence that the cult characterizations are accurate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Besides, if we remove all reference to the cult accusations, Carl7 will just come back and re-insert them again!

Wiki has not allowed others to address Ms. Barber's questionable registry/club/breeding practices, so why is she being allowed to continue to do so? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd, despite being the ``first`` registry, what independent, unbiased documentation has the ISSR provided to show that they are any ``different`` or more ``recognized`` than any other Shiloh registry, when it comes to accreditation by any outside organization. The fact of the matter is, the ISSR is no more ``recognized`` independently than any of the other Shiloh registries currently in operation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, like the 'self' proclaimed registries Ms. Barber references, the ISSR also issues its own ``pieces of paper`` based on Ms. Barber's own determination and her registry charge for these ``pieces of paper``.  What Ms. Barber is claiming about other registries (``Just because someone says something [and it's not illegal] that does not *make* it so!!``), is true of her own, as she has repeatedly throughout this discussion failed to provide unbiased, independent (as you stipulated as a rule for the inclusion of information or contribution) corroboration that her organization is any different.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn addition, the article, as now changed again, with Ms. Barber's numerous links to her own registry's/club's website are again both self-promoting and an attempt to steer readers to her business and to hinder Wikipedia's policy of ``neutrality`` in its articles.  These links are not unbiased, factual, neutral information.  Readers wishing to pursue more information re: her club/registry have the link at the bottom of the article (along with the other registry/club links) they can access if they want to hear more from her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt this stage, I think it is obvious that Ms. Barber has no intention of negotiating and compromising, in good faith and mutual respect, a ``neutral``, factual, independent, unbiased article.

The only other thing readers can fall back on is solid facts like movie ratings etc. This you are also against. So may I ask: what are we ``allowed`` to post by your ``standards``?

The personal opinions and prejudices of one point of view should not be able to prevail . The writer of the text which is now available has also given wrong information and openly ridiculed an organisation which is doing serious and academically authentic work in anthropology. If this can happen there is something wrong with the Wikipedia system. I think the idea of a 'stable text' remaining when the is controversy is right, but to leave the vandalised text in place defeats the whole purpose.

That particular philiosophy caused millions of people to DIE, and people who disagreed with them were put to death. Please read the Wiki entry on Facsists. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd, how do you know that the orignal entry on a page (with no corrobarting backup) is ``factual information``. You adjust your meaning of ``factual information`` to fit your particular brand of socialist bullshit. Just because Leithp is less of a ``Wiki Facsist`` is not a glowing statement either. The Wikipedia concept is doomed to failure becuase we have so-called editors like yourself who edit the pages to satisfy yourselves. A real editor has knowldege of a particular subject matter, and is supervised by people to ensure fairness of content. The REQUIRED registration solves no problem except less work for people like you, but still leaves an enormous creditability problem, which WIKI has been recently exposed to have.

32984901;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Wikilings exposed at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html  ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI had an email exchange with Matt Crypto (the, er, self-proclaimed ``Nobody`` who admits he knows nothing about the topic being discussed -though he improperly deletes it http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html ), asking him to stop spamming his childish comments and spamming his deletions of my Wikipedia posts and to stop emailing me. (He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his ``nah-nee-nah`` voice. It is amusing, though, to see Matt (a grown-up?) do it.  Here are the points that Matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN 1. Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Francis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the ``Nationalism`` movement in the USA, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party`` (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.htmlNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  German National Socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``Hakenkreuz.``   Professor Curry showed that many modern myths rely on a false belief that Nazis called themselves ``Nazis`` (Party members referred to themselves as ``National Socialists`` and did not use the term ``Nazis``).`;1166;1.0

34081023;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow that I'm unblocked, I can post my reply to you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are again using the same tactics you used a few weeks ago, in an apparent effort to censor me, and to prevent me from trying to improve this page by adding more credible information.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENImmediately after challenging me this last time, you had me blocked so that I could not respond.  One wonders what you are afraid of. You appear to fit the profile of those who use sneaky maneuvers to block people or to otherwise prevent edits containing information you disagree with, from ever seeing the light of day on Wikipedia. As reported on CNN and ABC last month, these tactics are why Wikipedia has been attacked so much lately, and why it's being taken less and less seriously as time goes on.  Such behavior is slowly turning Wikipeidia into a bit of a joke, and has helped diminish it's once significant potential for good.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour attempts at censorship reminds one of the scene in a movie years ago where a person who was about to be exposed on the front pages of their local newspaper, got up early the morning it was to be delivered, and ran through their neighborhood picking up all their neighbors' papers, in the misplaced belief that their neighbors would never learn the truth that was on the front page of that morning's paper.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInterestingly, rather than trying to support your allegations of danger and harmfulness with solid facts and evidence, you and others who share a common point of view that poppers are bad, continue to attack those who actually possess a high level of knowledge about these compounds. If you don't like what people with whom you do not agree try to post, rather than debating from a position of solid facts and underlying supporting documentation, you try to 'shoot the  messenger'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, in addition to your maneuvers to block me and prevent me from replying to your attacks or to post edits with accurate and clarifying information on nitrites/poppers, you attack me by implying that my screen name, 'Allabout' means I sell poppers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are wrong.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou also imply that I  am ``associated with http://www.allaboutpoppers.com/``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgain, you are wrong. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHowever, I happen to agree with those who say that the 'All About Poppers' site contains a great deal of credible information, supported with solid evidence. I've spent a great deal of time reading the site, and digging into the information presented there. I know of other similarly credible popper sites, as well.  Would you say I am ``associated`` with them, too?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs the record clearly shows, over the past few weeks, you and others (Some of whom may be one in the same, perhaps using proxy servers to mask true identities to try to avoid being charged with sock puppetry),  have engaged in an ongoing effort to prevent myself and others, with whom you do no agree on the subject of nitrites and poppers, from contributing to this page with some of our knowledge.  That is wrong, and you know it. (I note that, today, you have somehow successfully removed/erased the history that was showing up on the site's 'history' page. This history showed the ``summary`` comments for various edits.  It now appears you've allowed it back  in.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou say, ``just tell me: If this is all wrong and misleading.......``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have not said ``this is all wrong and misleading``. There is information on this page which is accurate, and there's information on this page which is not accurate.  But, when someone who is knowledgeable makes an effort to correct the inaccuracies on the page, they have been attacked with ongoing and relentless efforts to try to prevent their edits from remaining on the page. The record is very clear in that regard. (Again, as anyone can see, you have removed or erased the history for this page up until two reverts you did late on Jan 4, 2006)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou ask me ``why did you use this disclaimer``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wondered if those of you who have put up such a resistance to having more accurate information posted on this nitrites/poppers page, might have some personal hang ups or prejudices about some of the people whom they perceive as primarily using poppers recreationally. Are you homophobic?  Opposed to consenting adults making informed decisions about whether or not to have fun and take pleasure from something you may not agree with?  Anti-drug crusaders? Feel obliged to fight ``sin`` and ``pleasure`` wherever you find it, perhaps based on some deeply held religious beliefs?

34081023;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow that I'm unblocked, I can post my reply to you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are again using the same tactics you used a few weeks ago, in an apparent effort to censor me, and to prevent me from trying to improve this page by adding more credible information.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENImmediately after challenging me this last time, you had me blocked so that I could not respond.  One wonders what you are afraid of. You appear to fit the profile of those who use sneaky maneuvers to block people or to otherwise prevent edits containing information you disagree with, from ever seeing the light of day on Wikipedia. As reported on CNN and ABC last month, these tactics are why Wikipedia has been attacked so much lately, and why it's being taken less and less seriously as time goes on.  Such behavior is slowly turning Wikipeidia into a bit of a joke, and has helped diminish it's once significant potential for good.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour attempts at censorship reminds one of the scene in a movie years ago where a person who was about to be exposed on the front pages of their local newspaper, got up early the morning it was to be delivered, and ran through their neighborhood picking up all their neighbors' papers, in the misplaced belief that their neighbors would never learn the truth that was on the front page of that morning's paper.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInterestingly, rather than trying to support your allegations of danger and harmfulness with solid facts and evidence, you and others who share a common point of view that poppers are bad, continue to attack those who actually possess a high level of knowledge about these compounds. If you don't like what people with whom you do not agree try to post, rather than debating from a position of solid facts and underlying supporting documentation, you try to 'shoot the  messenger'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, in addition to your maneuvers to block me and prevent me from replying to your attacks or to post edits with accurate and clarifying information on nitrites/poppers, you attack me by implying that my screen name, 'Allabout' means I sell poppers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are wrong.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou also imply that I  am ``associated with http://www.allaboutpoppers.com/``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgain, you are wrong. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHowever, I happen to agree with those who say that the 'All About Poppers' site contains a great deal of credible information, supported with solid evidence. I've spent a great deal of time reading the site, and digging into the information presented there. I know of other similarly credible popper sites, as well.  Would you say I am ``associated`` with them, too?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs the record clearly shows, over the past few weeks, you and others (Some of whom may be one in the same, perhaps using proxy servers to mask true identities to try to avoid being charged with sock puppetry),  have engaged in an ongoing effort to prevent myself and others, with whom you do no agree on the subject of nitrites and poppers, from contributing to this page with some of our knowledge.  That is wrong, and you know it. (I note that, today, you have somehow successfully removed/erased the history that was showing up on the site's 'history' page. This history showed the ``summary`` comments for various edits.  It now appears you've allowed it back  in.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou say, ``just tell me: If this is all wrong and misleading.......``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have not said ``this is all wrong and misleading``. There is information on this page which is accurate, and there's information on this page which is not accurate.  But, when someone who is knowledgeable makes an effort to correct the inaccuracies on the page, they have been attacked with ongoing and relentless efforts to try to prevent their edits from remaining on the page. The record is very clear in that regard. (Again, as anyone can see, you have removed or erased the history for this page up until two reverts you did late on Jan 4, 2006)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou ask me ``why did you use this disclaimer``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wondered if those of you who have put up such a resistance to having more accurate information posted on this nitrites/poppers page, might have some personal hang ups or prejudices about some of the people whom they perceive as primarily using poppers recreationally. Are you homophobic?  Opposed to consenting adults making informed decisions about whether or not to have fun and take pleasure from something you may not agree with?  Anti-drug crusaders? Feel obliged to fight ``sin`` and ``pleasure`` wherever you find it, perhaps based on some deeply held religious beliefs? Or simply just believe that if you give people information, no matter how accurate it may be, that might indicate poppers may not be as harmful as some would like us to believe, that people will flock to them, and that somehow the end of the world will appear?

From the first edit I made, I was almost immeditely reversed, and edited.  Within hours of that first contribution, I was being threatened and censored.  Ultimately, I was blocked, charged with violating unknown-to-me 'rules' of Wikipedia, and otherwise censored, and rendered unable to contribute.  And, that, gentlemen, is what I've been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHowever, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here, and based on the news accounts last month on CNN, ABC Nightly News, and elsewhere, which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that I've been subjected to.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN `;1054;1.0

34347319;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:please stop threatening. you're throwing weight around in a way that mixes your admin power with that of a user, elevating your ``opinion`` above that of others. you have no right to do so. do you think you're better than me? if so, you're wrong. please stop addressing me as a child because you're an admin, when i freely, unilaterally removed the entire expose of OWB as a plagiarist. was it relevant to the article and important to post temporarily? it absolutely was, because he was attempting to use his external ``article`` to gain POV power, and he has been about as disruptive to the article as anybody could be. that he still claims he didn't claim a ``single sentence`` of the article as his own work shows quite clearly what you're dealing with. however, because he's not an overt vandal, his hand is held indefinitely. enough.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:have you considered the damage done by treating two different people as equally at fault in a given situation? i have noticed this before from you directly, katefan, and i'd appreciate it very much if you would at least examine it (once more, if you have already). the result is the discouragement of wikipedia's biggest asset: editors who leave material that will last. i am not your inferior, so please don't treat me as such. if you want to spend hours creating and encouraging editors who bring us things such as this (with a dedication page, no less), then IMO you're misguided. in any case i doubt quite strongly that you realize the effect of blasting into a situation, announcing (however subtly) you're an admin, and then acting as though you're just there to edit. that is not how it works. whether you realize it, your introductions are often launched to establish passive-aggressive superiority. i'll say it again: you are not my superior. you have admin power here, and are not a better editor than i am. please halt with the admin intimidation for issues that, if intervention were to be helpful, require the intervention of somebody who at least acts sincerely as an equal, not a parent. why is that so difficult for admins to understand? i know why, but maybe you can give it a think.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:if you doubt the subtle influence of your position as an admin, look no further than OWB's obsequiousness on your talk page. users know what the score is. i'm not going to play, and i've demonstrated repeatedly that my article editing here at wikipedia is in the top layer. i'm quite aware that many don't agree with my philosophy of human action and wikipedia's future (i.e., that encouraging disrupters and discouraging producers is a vacant policy), but i'm going to push it as far as it will go. it my theory begins by refusing to allow vandalistic interference in my comments, that's not necessarily something you couldn't support, katefan, you know. good editors could use the support of admins  far from the ``blitz onto the scene`` method where habitual disrupters and habitually superior editors are then treated as equal entities, with ``fresh start`` mantras (no, it's not the first time i've seen that from you, katefan) and an ``everybody's contributing equally`` approach that does nothing but swat the hands of editors who've fought, sometimes alone and for days, to preserve article integrity. doesn't work with children, nor with adults you're treating as children. the presumption of theoretical equality of action when arriving ``on the scene`` is probably the biggest mistake admins make here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:yes, my objection to your ``fresh start`` approach on the B&C; discussion page is quite serious. i don't believe that you should continue further in the facade of being an objective, normal editor on the page. you have set yourself up as everybody's superior, and such an approach was not necessary. why not let things sort themselves out a bit? did you notice i bowed out (after removing hundreds of my words)? did you notice that things were slowly improving without you? did you notice that somebody else wouldn't bow out? did you notice that i didn't immediately gut his atrocious frank hamer article (as would have been well within the bounds of wikipedia policy)? if not, why are you even pretending to help? there are healthier methods of dispute resolution than dispute denial. they may not seem as touchy-feely at first, but the results are longer lasting and ultimately far more respectful. OWB needed to face what he faced there, and wikipedia, and OWB, will be better off if this process isn't pretended away. you said something about ``i don't know what went on with you two``. really? all that went on was utterly public. i've had no private comm with OWB. so if you don't know what went on, then you didn't pay attention. if you're not paying attention, maybe you might consider stepping back and not jangling your admin keys so readily.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:i doubt what i've written here will make any difference, but i figured i'd try one more time to explain the very real damage that is rotting wikipedia. if you want to construe it as a ``personal attack`` (bleh) and ax it, then please ax your criticism of me at the same time. as the history here shows, i can't even get support on my own talk page when dealing in my own way (consciously using an intelligent, long-view approach, apparently far above the heads of most admins) with a direct death threat somebody made against me. pathetic. admins need to stop treating people as children at the first opportunity. the net result of this paternal approach is negative, though it requires a longer time horizon to recognize. sad to say, few people have such a horizon. that you can intervene with extraordinary power doesn't necessarily mean you should  a truth that is ignored here by admins more than it's respected.  `";513;1.0

34819787;I'd like to thank Ms. Selina Kyle for identifying a few more open proxies for us so we could block them.  Due to the high volume of vandalism that comes from open proxies (and the very low volume of legitimate edits), it's a general presumption that anybody who (a) edits through one and (b) generally acts like a shit, is a vandal.  Ms. Kyle meets both halves of that condition.  I don't recommend that she be unblocked any time soon (I really don't see any evidence that she has ever substantially contributed to the encyclopedia, and I have no reason to believe that she would start doing so were we to unblock her), but I may have been mistaken in identifying her with the program vandals she shared an open proxy with.  She is still a very disruptive user, and her current block is totally warranted on that basis.  I must say that using an open proxy in combination with her persistently combative and unfriendly attitude definitely has not helped her case.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN;2446;1.0
34827596;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN................................................................................NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN>>>>  I believe that what you can legitimately post in an encyclopedia like Wikipedia is factual information, as released to the public, by the entity that owns the information.  Everything else is to be considered pure speculation, gossip, rumors, or perhaps unauthorized leaks.  Even if a ``Ford insider`` knows something about the ``MKS`` concept car that has not been publicly announced by the Company , they SHALL NOT post it here (as some have already done) - doing so may be considered Corporate Espionage, and can result in termination, lawsuits, and prosecution.   I started to try to clean up all the speculation posts about the MKS - but gave up trying - it is just too deep now.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow if Ford Motor Company publicly acknowleges (and you can prove it with a link to a  legitimate Ford Motor Company Source - not from a fan / rumor / gossip or spy website),  then by all means it can and should be posted here.  For the time being, you have to go with the official company line - that the MKS is a concept car that ``strongly hints`` at a possible future full size Lincoln sedan.  But you can feel free to scour online news reports using Yahoo! or Google or some other search engine, and then post anything you find, from a reputable news source, that is directly quoting Bill Ford or Mark Fields or Anne Stevens or some other Company Executive or Spokesman.  I think the Company realizes there has been some mixed information released from various sources, and will try to straighten it all out in the coming days.  For the next few weeks, Ford will be observing public and press reactions to the MKS Concept Car, and then make a final decision about production possibilities - most likely after ``The Way Ahead`` on January 23rd.  In addition - Ford has many other upcoming Auto Shows, where more Concepts (and variations) and corporate announcements can be expected.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat said - I really do feel your pain.  The sudden and unexpected renaming of the 2007 Lincoln Aviator as the 2007 Lincoln ``MKX`` has produced no small amount of chaos and controversy; and then saying it is all about ``letters`` for Lincoln from now on, and then saying MKX is actually pronounced ``Mark X`` (which is alarmingly close to ``Mark Ten``), and then calling the ``MKS`` (pronounced ``Mark S``) as either a full size Concept Car (which would be E or F class), or a midsize D3-platform based midsize LS replacement (which is itself a mid-plus D/E class chassis) - it is all very confusing.  The best we can do at this point is be patient - wait for the Corporate Executives and Marketing folks get their ``official story`` straight, and let the Full Battle Fury of the Auto Show settle down a bit with the dust; and then post ``just the facts Ma'am`` on Wikipedia.

35313913;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Still The Achilles' Heel of Wikipedia.==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMaybe someone who checks in on this talk page might now where to go with it?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst, a public reply to Dragons flight, (and maybe his own sockpuppet ``Freestylefrappe``):  Hardly a ``sockpuppet`` when I used the very same name....  followed by a ``2``.  Or are you talking about blocking Pgio ``too``, who simply agreed that someone here is quite a J_rk?  I asked so clearly that you wouldn't take away WMC's opportunity to block me himself....  I would have been proud.  But you knew that too, right?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedians: I freely admit, that my own level of civility here has lowered....  even against my own admonishment to others to avoid such behavior.  All I can say, is that it is a VERY difficult dynamic to avoid when some here play by such despicably manipulative and base rules of engagement.  I'm thinking of that dichotomy between people who claim that their Ends or so worthy, that they should get a pass on their occasional stray from acceptable means, vs. those who retain some hold on the idea that they will be judged by their Means, no matter the final outcome.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is made all the more difficult where users such as Admin WMC, who know full well the self imposed limits of their opponents, demand verbal civility on one hand, and yet play such extensive games of ``pretend to forget``, ``I didn't see that`` written ten times before, and ALWAYS selectively choose the lowest hanging fruit in a nest of specific challenges to their type of behavior, contributions, and edits.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWorldly people understand the sensitive nature of situations like these.  Educated people (especially those through the School of Hard Knocks) know that these situations are more often set-ups, initiated by the manipulator.  The manipulator has at least learned the fine art of camouflage where they can hide very well 'in plain sight' flying the banner of Democracy.  Failing to acknowledge this simple possibility, marks one as either the manipulator, or just a pseudo-intellect.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I've said before, and will say again....   If users like WMC were genuine, they'd acknowledge human fallibility and the basic rights of dissident opinion.  Doing so, WMC would quickly gain my support of his presentations on mainstream understanding.  He gets that part right VERY OFTEN and has demonstrated a tenacity to seeing his POV upheld.  Good for him, and why I have absolutely no trouble with his dominance over others trying to write articles presenting such information.  Yet why?  Why does he refuse to acknowledge his lack of verse in material outside of his very public field of knowledge?  Why does he go so far in his chilling drive to stifle the good faith presentations of non-mainstream fields?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease, I'm not just talking about aether theories alone.  The electric fields have plenty to say about corollary/causal dynamics in cogent presentations about a very possible relationship to atmospheric phenomenon.  Damn if WMC shouldn't be reading some of that stuff instead of JUST pointing out how it's counter to the formulas used in current Climate Models.  I mean, just forget about the LONG history of trial and repeated errors in aether postulation, the mysteries of electricity still surround us and we would all benefit by keeping an open mind about that.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the least, do we really think it wise to insist by near constant omission, any possibility that Birkeland or Alfvén currents effect our conductive atmosphere.  I'm not saying that WMC's models need to be trashed or even that he should modify them this afternoon, but it's highly suspicious that he suppresses the postulations and formulations from even the notable sources working on competitive modeling.  It is so suspicious, that is why I question his objectivity, and point out that he IS a PAID agent of tax dollars vested in a particular model. That he doesn't acknowledge and recuse himself, is just annoying to say the least.  That Wikipedia doesn't impose some boundaries on this user's blinding conflict of interest, casts a far greater doubt upon Wikipedia NPOV all together.  `;2381;1.0

In fact, I hold them in high respect, as i can't count how many times an anon or new user has cleaned up a spelling mistake or grammer error after I've finished making a new article. But this article is indeed an exception, and we must react acordingly. I'm a good - faith editor, but I'm no sucker. These vindidctive users play us up but good. They don't care if we let down SEMI in an act of kindness and good faith, they just start anew. Even Mr. Sidaway stated that vandalism skyrocketed when he deactivated SEMI and numerous charts have shown (again by Mr. Sidaway) that SEMI is benefitting the article. And a user has already shown what ``incredibly constructive`` edits are made when its down (the addition of a coma! That's a Major edit for sure!). Honestly, the statistics and our tireless hours of pointless vandlaism reverting don't lie. We could go on and on, but what's the point..? Vandalism will not desist. The only reason vandalism decreses is because of SEMI. I leave you with the history, and I hope you'll think on it. But I doubt it. - `;286;1.0

Moreover, I continue to cite sources, while some add POV, without citing sources - which I think is ``controversial`` considering the ``strong views`` some have on this subject, and certainly an adversity to historical fact. Moreover, this article is just getting started; yet some continue to act as if the current version is perfect. It is not, again, it is just getting started. As for the linking, and formatting - again - it is just getting started; and if not for the ``instant reverts`` would most likely be easier to fill out before getting to small edits. I started the current version since some did not find this article interesting until deciding to add POV to the subject matter without much knowledge, and more importantly, historical facts, on this subject itself.

36100765;"`For many people, the sight, even the thought, of a snake causes feelings of strong dislike. Snakes are repugnant to most of us, which may be exactly why God used a ``serpent,`` or snake, as a symbol of Satan. We should naturally regard him as extremely repulsive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSnake Satan is the greatest loser of all eternity. He was at one time an obedient, close servant of God - magnificent in appearance and position (Ezekiel 28:12-15). But he threw it all away through his rebellion, and was cast down to the earth (Ezekiel 28:16-17).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo one influenced Satan to sin the way that he now influences humans. Satan is an original. He decided solely by himself, he made the deliberate choice, to go from good to bad. See Could Satan Repent?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSatan is the Christian's greatest enemy, the most serious danger to one's eternal life. We need not live in fear of him however. Despite his now being much more powerful, we ultimately have the upper hand over him and all of his demons. We have the power of God's Holy Spirit to guide and protect us. See Why Demons Are Afraid Of You.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSatan's greatest weapon against us now is deception. Much of the world today cannot tell right from wrong, whether in matters of religion, or simple everyday life. So often what is wicked and despicable is actually glorified, while what is good and decent is sometimes viewed as somehow wrong or foolish. Satan is the ultimate expert at covering truth with lies and misconceptions. See What Does Satan Look Like?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe good news is that Satan has already lost. The Life, Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ has seen to that. The day is not far off when Satan is going to get all that is coming to him.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFact Finder: What will be Satan's fate for all eternity?NEWLINE_TOKENRevelation 20:10NEWLINE_TOKENAs the rain poured down, it fell upon the roaring fires that were consuming everything within their reach, creating monstrous clouds of black smoke. The once lively village had been reduced to scattered lifeless forms and rubble.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJacob Carter scowled at the destruction that had clearly been caused by one Goa'uld or another. The majority of the carcasses held wounds from a staff weapon blast, and foot prints could be found in the sandy soil.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe planet, Shara'lor, was at one point being utilized as a mining planet, and indigenous people as slaves. Evidently the Goa'uld had exhausted the planet's natural resources, and felt the need to destroy the members of the civilization who didn't meet the requirements to become hosts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Jacob! We've found a survivor, however, she may not live much longer!``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJacob followed the sound of Martouf's voice to the perimeter of the village where the trees became dense and nearly blocked out the sun entirely. On the ground, before Martouf and Nial, lay a young woman donned in lavender silks and red furs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJacob knelt beside the trembling form and checked her pulse: racing. If he listened closely, he could hear a wheezing that originated in the young woman's chest; her breathing was erratic and she gasped for any air she could catch. It was clear that the she was an asthmatic, it was equally clear that she would die without help.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRight about then, her chest was probably feeling as if an iron band was contracting around it. The wheezing was growing louder, her short gasps were rapid and extremely difficult. The wheezing caused a coughing fit, and between spasms, she struggled for air. When it was over, she was weak from the exertion, and her breathing had grown worse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``What's wrong with her?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``She's got something called asthma, and unless we do something soon, she's not going to live much longer.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMartouf wasn't sure what to do, he was by no means knowledgeable of Tau'ri illnesses, consequently he had no idea as to how to cure them. Other than a blending.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Martouf, it's been determined that Ulrica will pass on shortly, leaving Thalan in need of a host.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I thought the same, however...`` Martouf's voice trailed off, and he didn't really need to finish his sentence, for Jacob knew what he was thinking. This young girl might not be a willing host, and if that was a case...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Can you hear me?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the sound of Jacob's voice being directed at her, the young woman turned to look at him with the most stunning brown eyes. They were large and soulful, their color almost bordering on black. They showed her fright, and they pleaded with him for help.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``We can save you, but in order for us to do that, you'll have to be blended... You'll have to share your physical body with another being, you understand? You'd be sharing your body...

She was peaceful now, breathing deeply and smoothly. The blending had been a perfect success; a few hours had passed since Thalan entered the young woman, and she would soon wake. Martouf remained with Jacob for most of the time after the blending, but he had been called away a few minutes previous.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe young woman had long black hair, and when she opened her eyes just before the blending, they had been the color of kohl.

Almost reminded him of an amazon woman from some movie he had seen several years preceding his blending.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe clothing she wore gave her a tribal appearance. Lavender silks embroidered with flowers wrapped around her lithe form to create a dress. The sleeveless coat made from reddish-brown fur indicated that her people were hunters.

Feathers and beads had been added into a few tiny braids in her black hair.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJacob's silent reverie was shattered by a shrill scream and the young woman's swift movement from the bed to the entranceway, where she was met by two Tok'ra guards. She had a crazed look in her eyes, terror elicited by the feeling of Thalan's memories, emotions, experiences and everything else merging with her own.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``It's okay, don't worry, we're not going to hurt you. Just calm down and take a deep breath.

Jacob caught her just in time, but as soon as she regained her strength she clawed at his arms.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Something's wrong with me! What have you done?!`` She demanded when Jacob pushed her away from him and stood up. He silently wished that Thalan would take control, but he knew the reason his friend was refraining from that action.

Jacob doubted that many civilizations off of Earth used the term 'bloody'. He doubted *any* off-worlders used it.

36100765;"`For many people, the sight, even the thought, of a snake causes feelings of strong dislike. Snakes are repugnant to most of us, which may be exactly why God used a ``serpent,`` or snake, as a symbol of Satan. We should naturally regard him as extremely repulsive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSnake Satan is the greatest loser of all eternity. He was at one time an obedient, close servant of God - magnificent in appearance and position (Ezekiel 28:12-15). But he threw it all away through his rebellion, and was cast down to the earth (Ezekiel 28:16-17).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo one influenced Satan to sin the way that he now influences humans. Satan is an original. He decided solely by himself, he made the deliberate choice, to go from good to bad. See Could Satan Repent?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSatan is the Christian's greatest enemy, the most serious danger to one's eternal life. We need not live in fear of him however. Despite his now being much more powerful, we ultimately have the upper hand over him and all of his demons. We have the power of God's Holy Spirit to guide and protect us. See Why Demons Are Afraid Of You.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSatan's greatest weapon against us now is deception. Much of the world today cannot tell right from wrong, whether in matters of religion, or simple everyday life. So often what is wicked and despicable is actually glorified, while what is good and decent is sometimes viewed as somehow wrong or foolish. Satan is the ultimate expert at covering truth with lies and misconceptions. See What Does Satan Look Like?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe good news is that Satan has already lost. The Life, Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ has seen to that. The day is not far off when Satan is going to get all that is coming to him.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFact Finder: What will be Satan's fate for all eternity?NEWLINE_TOKENRevelation 20:10NEWLINE_TOKENAs the rain poured down, it fell upon the roaring fires that were consuming everything within their reach, creating monstrous clouds of black smoke. The once lively village had been reduced to scattered lifeless forms and rubble.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJacob Carter scowled at the destruction that had clearly been caused by one Goa'uld or another. The majority of the carcasses held wounds from a staff weapon blast, and foot prints could be found in the sandy soil.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe planet, Shara'lor, was at one point being utilized as a mining planet, and indigenous people as slaves. Evidently the Goa'uld had exhausted the planet's natural resources, and felt the need to destroy the members of the civilization who didn't meet the requirements to become hosts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Jacob! We've found a survivor, however, she may not live much longer!``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJacob followed the sound of Martouf's voice to the perimeter of the village where the trees became dense and nearly blocked out the sun entirely. On the ground, before Martouf and Nial, lay a young woman donned in lavender silks and red furs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJacob knelt beside the trembling form and checked her pulse: racing. If he listened closely, he could hear a wheezing that originated in the young woman's chest; her breathing was erratic and she gasped for any air she could catch. It was clear that the she was an asthmatic, it was equally clear that she would die without help.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRight about then, her chest was probably feeling as if an iron band was contracting around it. The wheezing was growing louder, her short gasps were rapid and extremely difficult. The wheezing caused a coughing fit, and between spasms, she struggled for air. When it was over, she was weak from the exertion, and her breathing had grown worse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``What's wrong with her?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``She's got something called asthma, and unless we do something soon, she's not going to live much longer.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMartouf wasn't sure what to do, he was by no means knowledgeable of Tau'ri illnesses, consequently he had no idea as to how to cure them. Other than a blending.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Martouf, it's been determined that Ulrica will pass on shortly, leaving Thalan in need of a host.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I thought the same, however...`` Martouf's voice trailed off, and he didn't really need to finish his sentence, for Jacob knew what he was thinking. This young girl might not be a willing host, and if that was a case...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Can you hear me?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the sound of Jacob's voice being directed at her, the young woman turned to look at him with the most stunning brown eyes. They were large and soulful, their color almost bordering on black. They showed her fright, and they pleaded with him for help.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``We can save you, but in order for us to do that, you'll have to be blended... You'll have to share your physical body with another being, you understand? You'd be sharing your body... This being would be in your head, and you'd be able to hear it, but you'd be cured.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe girl's eyes widened, and when she went to speak, another coughing fit began. It couldn't have even been called a cough, it was more of a painful hack that was slowly taking it's toll on her body.

If the accusation is that ``Falun Gong practitioners have a tendency to cult suicides, because the self-immolators were reputedly practitioners``, this is obviously both an association fallacy and a false analogy. Compare it to a classic racist sentiment from the Deep South: ``A nigger has approached a white woman, therefore niggers are evil, so any nigger must be hung.`` And it's not a No True Scotsman fallacy to make an argument: ``Falun Gong unequivocally doesn't approve of suicide and murders.

36667170;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis article is being rewritten at Jack Abramoff/AbramoffRefactor. Please take note of the existing notes and outline, and follow in the spirit of that rewrite/refactor. Comments welcome. Thanks, -NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Archives ==NEWLINE_TOKEN* Archive 1 Friday 12th August 2005  Talk:Jack Abramoff/Archive 1 I made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==COPYVIO==NEWLINE_TOKENThis article and it's sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia.  They're essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal.  Both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia.  They need to be deleted immediately.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlot of this article DOES seem to be a blatent copyvio.  Tyco, as below, was edited (the text was accurate, but half the news story was pasted in here).  You cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story, attribute a link, and it not be a copywrite violation.  It's called Plagerism. NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKEN=== Tyco ===NEWLINE_TOKENAlmost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the WAPO article.  I've removed  part of it, as it needs to be re-written. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think I've cleaned much of the CopyVio stuff up, hopefully.  There is alot of non-essential stuff in this article about peripheral people, and not about Abramoff, however.  It needs to be cleaned up more, as the article meanders alot here and there.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I reverted some things you took out (outside the Tyco section), like in the ``Early years`` section and in the intro about DeLay. That material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it.  Just providing a link is not attribution, and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism, not 'fair use' unless you are quoting. Also, if you are going to say 'the los angeles times reports' you need to source the times, not a NEWLINE_TOKENsecondary source (i.e. democracy now).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI modified the quote and attributed properly.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The speech from Tom DeLay is a direct quote (it's in quotations) so of course it is taken word-for-word from the source. I'll tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. Here's the primary source for the other thing.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo problem.  If I see something that is probable CopyVio I tend to chop it out first, and then rework it (I don't usually just leave it out, if the quote is accurate).  Btw have you found a link for the franken quote, I can't find anything other than on blogs.  Honestly I'm not sure what the relevence to an article on Abramoff is, really, anyway.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: The ``forced abortions`` part was originally reported by Brian Ross at ABC News for 20/20 on March 13, 1998. It also appears in Al Franken's book The Truth (with jokes)'' in the ``Tom DeLay Saipan Sex Tour and Jack Abramoff Casino Getaway`` chapter. Since we've agreed that primary sources are key, i've change the attribution in the article.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== The Indian tribes scandal ==NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENThis area is a mess, I have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. It may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the Reed, Norquist etc pages to it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBasically we need fewer facts and more context. At the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI moved the whole scandal to its own page. This makes much more sense since although Abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players, in particular Ralph Reed. I am not doing this to hide the scandal, I think that people looking for info on i;2399;1.0

37301808;"`== Insertion of Disputed tag ==NEWLINE_TOKENThis article has more than seriously bad writing. It is an article on a subject which has no business being in an encyclopedia at all. Much of what is passed as information here is actually speculation by myriad newspaper editors. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn encyclopedic article should not just contain ``facts``, let alone unproven allegations. It should also have a context for those facts, and the facts should be checked and balanced.  For instance, it is also a fact that the Ohio 18th Congressional district is steel, coal, union country and considered a trade-union, Democrat seat by the DNC; they rank it very, very high on their target list of seats to win back at any cost. That the current occupant of that seat also holds a house leadership position makes the target all the more compelling. Where are these concepts in the article series?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAdding to the confusion is the extreme reliance on very recent press reports - many of those reports originally generated from speculation on sealed court documents.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurther, statements like ``Bob Ney (R-OH) lied when he said he was ``duped`` by Abramoff and lied again on financial disclosure forms when he said that a nonprofit had paid for the trip.`` show the extraordinary bias and excitment of the article authors. Even the opening sentence shows not even a faint pass at fairness: ``The monetary influence of Jack Abramoff ran deep in Washington, as Jack Abramoff spent millions of dollars to influence and entertain Republican politicians.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI can't clean this up because I have neither the time nor the detailed info. More importantly, I don't believe anyone but the prosecutor and the defense teams have the detailed info, and none of that will be revealed for quite some time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs to the press articles as sources, History is already showing how badly the press handled many of the controveries of the past year. The facts of the Katrina response now show that CNN, et al were wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong on way to many of their charges and reports. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI use Wikipedia a lot, and want to see it thive. Articles like this add nothing, mislead the impressionable, and can only harm the reputation of Wiki's in general and Wikipedia specifically.

37469927;`To whom it may concern. hello I am a student in a univeristy computer lab was hoping to add relevant discussion to several articles which i am researching. However when i clicked on ``edit page`` a message appeared stating this IP address was blocked. I searched the IP address and found this ``user talk`` page which clearly showed individuals were using Wikipedia immaturely. Is it possible to undo the block so that i may complete my school work. The room is crowded with others ingaged in group work so relocation to an unblocked computer is not really an option for me. i thank you for taking the time to read this statement, have a good evening,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENsincerely,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAmanda NEWLINE_TOKEN`;2199;1.0

Regardless of the barnacles that cling to its hull, I assert that the Wiki concept is, fortunately, apparently more powerful than the base human dynamics it nurtures  but does not ultimately tolerate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENi am asked to let it drop. I don't claim to be a Wiki expert, but I bet there is a complaint procedure. Anyone care to point me in the right direction? The article stub was summarily deleted three times, but after that, the vandal chose to insert an alert of possible deletion instead. This indicates to me that the proper procedure was not followed the first three times. What's the complaint procedure? My further complaint will be regarding the dynamic of portraying someone who stands up for themselves in a reasoned and civil way as having an attitude problem. That's probably the most corrosive thing to a volunteer effort.`;1395;1.0

38391504;Oh I couldn't agree more. Serbia would never manipulate a census, but Serbia and Montenegro would, and does at that too. All fucking countries manipulate the census, democratic or not. Greece has as many Greek Orthodox followers as it has ethnic Greeks. So how about the Greeks who converted to Islam under the Ottomans? All other nationalities did (given that Bosniaks and Pomaks are Slavic converts), not to mention many Albanians or all their ethnic varieties too: No, any Muslim is a TURK in Greece, even if he speaks Greek as a first language. Get this, I KNOW Greek Sunni Muslims. And how about my stupid country? Croatia? To prove that I am not some nationalist Pro-Croat Anti-Serb - Zagreb sees no Slavic Catholics as Serb, even though in and around Dubrovnik (where I spent most of my young life) there is a traditional group of Serbs who are Catholic... again, I know some of these people by name. Not according to Zagreb though... Italy plays down the number of Slovenes in her,  Finland claims that there are fewer Swedes there than Sweden says... France plays down ALL Alsatians to declare themselves German ... Poland exaggerates the number of people who call themselves Pol+something in Belarus and the Ukraine. That's the way of the world, and bang in the middle of all the injustice is a country called Serbia & Montenegro, so PURE since the overthrow if Miloseveic that they could never tell lies in their censa! Perhaps the world should now look to Belgrade for a moral lead!  6 February 2006NEWLINE_TOKEN;731;1.0

38719176;`. Some just make things up as if it substitutes for the truth, and use ``mistakes`` as ``proof`` of being ``disruptive.`` But, very few actually can cite facts, inaccurate edits, nor bother to even think about checking sources cited. It is much easier to ``complain about Theodore7`` and to ``revert`` since following Wikipedia's principles about biting newcomers is an ``excuse`` since it ``does not exist`` and ``does not happen`` to any newcomer. And, if they mention it - they are ``using`` it since it doesn't exist, etc., etc. This is just one of the many problems Wikipedia newcomers face with such people. It is so much easier not to care about any subject, nor to check sources (as I do as a journalist) and to find inaccurate and unfactual materials while avoiding POV. But, to play games, to have personality conflicts as if they actually know the people they are writing to. They avoid resolving matters peacefully, but highly enjoy creating fights, building molehills into mountains, and love throwing out wild accusations. They don't ask - they assume - they immediately accuse, then complain loudly. They take everthing personally - all the while - not reading, checking sources, nor citing sources themselves on the subjects in question but adding plenty of their own POV that is not neutral, nor cited with sources. If sources run counter to their POV - then they use ruses to attempt to divert attention: and ask for RFCs on Wikipedia members who just got here, and request arbitration to resolve situations they have not even started to resolve on their own - yet claiming that they have tried. Perhaps, if some spend much more time actually checking sources, citing them, and making sure that the encylopedic materials are factual then, the ``revert wars`` by some who want to re-write history to fit their own personal views would end, and Wikipedia could be that much more successful. So, if one is to gather evidence - show just where my edits are vandalism - where? I'd like to see it. Show my edit summaries. Show my edits, and don't cite my early mistakes as ``proof`` of being ``disruptive`` since I'd like to see someone claim they do not make mistakes themselves. Oh, one more thing. When a person defends themselves - try not to dismiss it as a ``diatribe`` - but actually read it in context and take responsbility for one's own ``claims`` against the person - in this case, a new member of Wikipedia. I've had enough of my comments being taken out of context, then pasted onto RFC and arbitration sections - and used as ``proof`` of me being a bad person, and disruptive. I say different, and have the right to defend myself against what I consider to be a classic case of biting Wikipedia newcomers. I will take credit for my honest mistakes, but not for accusations that are false. My evidence are the comments, and retorts, and my edits - which, are cited, and soucred. Any arbitrator who wants to know more about my edits and comments can feel free to ask, or to view my comments IN CONTEXT and not TAKEN OOUT OF CONTEXT by some who are doing the constant ``complaining.`` I see no proof of any infactual edits on my part. And, my early mistakes are just that - mistakes that most newcomers to Wikipedia make. That does not justify, say your own comments Bunchofgrapes, and those of the other ``revert warriors`` - who, in my opinion, are ruining Wikipedia. So, I've made inquiries elsewhere to make sure that perhaps this comes to an end, and that my case can be used as an example of what happens - negatively - to newcomers who run up against those who signed the RFC, and asked for arbitration. My evidence is there - my work to this time, my edits, sourcing, and using the Talk Pages - which I do not abuse, but use to add comments relevant to the subject at hand`;1567;1.0

38790176;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==brainhell==NEWLINE_TOKENThanks Robert.  I signed my comment with four tildes, at least the one that appeared on my own page.  I apologize if I posted it elsewhere in the wrong pace, or without a signature. I see that Lucky 6.9's user page now says only ``Vacation time...`` and displays a stress meter.  His user talk page says ``Wikistress is building. I, therefore, have left the building for a brief time.`` I see no  acknowledgment that he realizes that he lost his temper.  This in your inference.  But even were that true, and despite his apology to me, and his promise not to delete my posts (without addressing what he'll do to the posts of others), he has shown himself temperamentally unsuited to administrate.

39436573;` February 2006 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== The Power of Wikipedia ===NEWLINE_TOKENWhen most major newspapers faced significant wrath for publishing even a part of the cartoons, Wikipedia still stands high even after having all the cartoons in its page for more than a week. People could intimidate the editors of those newspapers and force them to resign, but nothing could be done against Wikipedia. I feel, this is a wonderful attribute of Wikipedia that is on exhibition at the time of this crises. The collective responsibility combined with civilized reactions, makes this as the best exponent of Free Speech.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Agreed. The power of the Internet and Wikipedia shows us that fundamental people (of different faiths and not just Muslims) are not able to ban or protest violently against controversial drawings or pictures.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm quite disappointed by the reactions I've read in the topics below, namely those arrogant and insensitive replies to those who were requesting the cartoons to be moved to another location, or to provide a link for it (e.g. Hitokirishinji and Kyaa the Catlord in response to Yosri). The original posts are very civil and humane, whereas it seems in the responses people have picked up a very proud and arrogant attitude for keeping the pictures up no matter what the others say. Replies such as ``If you are mortally offended by wikipedia and western values then there is simply no reason for you to visit the english wikipedia, or indeed, any western site.`` (not sure who posted that one) definitely don't go together with the concept of responsibility when disseminating information. If wikipedia is just a place where the authors demonstrate their power over MSNBC or whoever else you've depicted as weak (which in my opinion would translate as more sensitive to those different from the mainstream readers they have) then I guess all that's on the page is justified. Otherwise I would really urge you to think twice before you post. I personally do not have a clear opinion if the small size images are still offensive to people or not. But if enough people say it is, I think this is enuogh reason to take it off. Trying to explain to them how they should feel or how in your world insulting them is completely normal will only fuel anger at your own world, and you'll be wondering why these muslims react the way they do. Think about it: it's the western media (in the true sense of the word, including internet and sites such as wikipedia) who disseminate information and pictures, the western readers who read it and form their opinion, and the topic in question is about people who for the most part don't even understand english. And when the few who can read english give their input, you tell them not to visit the english sites if they're offended. Doesn't this pave the way for the isolation of a group of people who don't speak your language, and yet you keep writing about?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso think about this: not every post is about proving one's point over the others, or for the pure goal of winning over some debate, but sometimes just about someone's input on how they feel about or experience the topic in question.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN SerkanNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Actaully, this has nothing to do with struggle and power over MSNBC. In fact, I really couldn't care less what MSNBC has to say about wikipedia. Wikipedia is created by a community of editors, many from every type of background imaginable. So explain to me how MSNBC and their poll has any accurate ability to measure the consensus of the Wikipedia community? I would be willing to bet the number of people who voted on that MSNBC poll have ever registered or logged onto Wikipedia. So, I'll be clear MSNBC is not Wikipedia and its opinion most likely has no bearing here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Secondly, we have never said ``go away if you don't like it``. Instead, we have said ``turn off load images`` so as to avoid seeing the image at all. Check the archieves and stop trying to shove words into our mouths. By your logic ``...still offensive to people or not. But if enough people say it is, I think this is enuogh reason to take it off...`` we should remove the state of Israel from the map because its very existence angers and offends many Muslims. And we should remove Piss Christ and Lolicon. Again, we've been through this before, read the archives. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Lastly, these ``non-english`` speaking people who have an opinion. Why limit it to Muslims who can't read English? Why not give everyone a chance to express their opinion? Why do you feel that the people who are offended and cannot speak English only get a valid opinion? What about people can't speak English and are not offended, I suppose for you they aren't nearly important enough? So to be truely fair, we would have to poll the entire world practically and I'm sure;2167;1.0

That's at the core of this problem, you did not notice that an admin skipped over the tfd process and speedied something when there is no rule explicitly against having an opinion in a userbox?  Rather, there is Jimbo saying there shouldn't be any.

I made no attack on any editor, that you perceive it as such is truly sad, but such is life.  Perhaps with time you will learn the intricacies of the language.

40057325;i don't see where any of the book references have anything to do with yugos. i guess the books may have yugo references in them, but if they do, that should be so stated, exactly, or else the refernces to books is POV and unverified. and who is this conscensous on the porsche thing? who forms the conscensous. if i and other people with no real knowledge about programming start an article, and wipe out any corrections, as your editors have do here, do they get to form the conscensous? and if you, who are an expert on the subject edit it, and they roll it back, is that okay with you? you can not have website claiming to be fact. yet that is compiled by people with a Npov, with an axe to gring, or who repeat rumors, affecting peoples lives and livlehoods. this is what wiki editors did to John Seigenthaler. i am sure you a familiar with that. i used to live in san antonio, and being an anglo, i have a point of view on racism in SA. should i pubish an article, or edit an article on sa? i could prove that it is a problem. but i wouldn't do that, because i am not a expert on race relations, or have a degree in sociology, so i don't have a right to pubish that as fact as wiki publishes articles about people and things. you can not just let a bunch of people publish what ever they think in a public forum where some people are going to take it as truth because you call your self an encylopedia. and wiki articles are blindly republished as truth in othe online content. so it is not my legal threats that matter. it will be resolved on a much higher level that mine. this whole thing is why bill gates doesn't make windows open source. wouldn't that make your job so much fun, when anyone can change the operating system at any second?

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::: I think it is a personal attack, because you have singled out Nescio out of at least four editors who disagree with you emphatically. Nescio has shown good faith here, and your efforts to get him banned because he disagrees with you do not reflect well on your own good faith.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::In reality, quite the opposite is occuring. My efforts are focused on the goal of exposing  abuse of moderators good intentions in order to get others banned who do not share his point of view.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh, and, just out of curiousity, WHY IS THIS NOT ON NESCIO'S USERPAGE?! Can someone reasonable please get it OFF the police state discussion?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The reason why this is not on nescio's user page is because he keeps deleting it in violation of WP:VAND policy. This issue also pertains directly to this article since at least four users have been harassed and banned by Nescio's false accusations concerning this article. Ask him why he continues to delete this question about his ``edits''``.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Actually, I'd like to ask you why you (a) persist in disruption of this page and (b) won't sign in and insist on using so many open proxy IP addresses?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::(a) This is not a ``disruption`` of this page. This discussion pertains deirectly to anyone who wishes to edit this article because if they edit in a manner that  does not agree with, they will likely be harassed and banned by Nescio and his false accusations. People should be outraged that users and/or moderators are abusing thier powers. (b) If I were to sign on under my username, it would most certainly be banned in short order. I wish to see this issue resolved for all parties involved, but I am not willing to risk my status as an editor because of Nescio's frivilous accusations.  `;1112;1.0

40963321;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==The following is a COMPLAINT AGAINST  for harassing user's about the Police State page==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==It seems that many users have had problems with  harassment and vandalism==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN, why do you continually harass other users and then falsly accuse them of ``vandalism`` or other wiki-infringements? Please, do not delete this comment, I am only here as a mediator and this is NOT a personal attack. Only a simple question as to what motivates you to defame other users.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Here are the examples that I have compiled since being introduced to this issue. We have  who complains about your harassment on this talk page above. “I have not attacked you. Actually, quite the reverse. I have not exercized censorship. Quite the reverse. What's it called when you accuse others of being something that you actually are?”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: describes your actions as “rootless accusations of ``vandalism`` in response to my recent edit of the wikipedia article ``police state`` don't even pass the straight face test.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: even took the time to write a letter to the administrators about your behavior.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Dear Administrators:NEWLINE_TOKEN:``I would like to file a complaint against user ``nescio`` for wanton vandalism of the article entitled ``Police State``. User Nescio has been deleting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e.g. historical police state examples `` Chile under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet`` and ``Argentina under the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional``, as well as other examples . This childish and irrational behaviour has resulted in a blatant misrepresentation of the facts, which is detrimental to Wikipedia's credibility and accuracy. I have tried to reason with this user, but it is unfortunately to no avail.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Regretfully , I have no choice but to request that this user be blocked from editing at this time. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Sincerely yours,NEWLINE_TOKEN:User Winston SmithNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: describes you as “the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia” while encouraging you to “Please stop this childish behavior.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal * has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. I then placed a warning on  talk page, which he promptly removed. He continues to remove the warnings.  has requested sources for the addition, at least five have been provided, yet  refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war.      is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page  while falsely accusing me of stalking  and sock puppetry.     NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I have to say that Nescio and others had understandable grounds on which to suspect you of sockpuppetry. Fact is, you appeared on scene the day of/shortly after three genuine sockpuppets appeared, and you shared the same POV and short history of editing.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Please explain what makes you think that  is a sockpuppet? Can you cite these actions of VinnyCee that are considered to be those of a sock-puppet?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: I just did. It turns out that Vinny Cee is not a sockpuppet (at least, of anything we checked), but there was good reason to suspect she was.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::So VinnyCee is not a sock puppet. This means that Nescio's accusation of him being a sock puppet is false. Did you ``check`` into whether the other accusations made by Nescio against other users are also false? I would bet that they are.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:It seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the Police state article without your viewpoint. This is against WP:NPOV policy. Please stop harassing users otherwise more effective measures will have to be undertaken.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The edit wars have not been between you and only Nescio. They have been between only you and many other users.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::As expected, you removed this comment for discussion in violation of wikipedia’s vandalism rules. Please do not remove this again.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Again,  is in violation of the vandalism clause. As was predicted by the users who brought me into the discussion,  has employed his moderator lackeys to ban anyone who is critical of his vandalism.  is not above the rules of Wikipedia. It makes one wonder why he is such a proponent of not allowing anonymous users to post at Wikipedia. It's probably one's only recourse after being unjustly banned by his moderators. .   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnother moderator has abused his or her powers to ban a user who is simply inquiring about why  continually harasses users who do not share his point of view. Removing this inquiry is in itself a violation of WP:VAND. Please do not continue to remove this legitimate question.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Please Stop Removing Warnings.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Why do you continue to vandalise your own user page? Please leave user comments on this page. How can you rationalize that this inquiry is a ``personal attack``?   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::: I think it is a personal attack, because you have singled out Nescio out of at least four editors who disagree with you emphatically. Nescio has shown good faith here, and your efforts to get him banned because he disagrees with you do not reflect well on your own good faith.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::In reality, quite the opposite is occuring. My efforts are focused on the goal of exposing  abuse of moderators good intentions in order to get others banned who do not share his point of view.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh, and, just out of curiousity, WHY IS THIS NOT ON NESCIO'S USERPAGE?! Can someone reasonable please get it OFF the police state discussion?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The reason why this is not on nescio's user page is because he keeps deleting it in violation of WP:VAND policy. This issue also pertains directly to this article since at least four users have been harassed and banned by Nescio's false accusations concerning this article. Ask him why he continues to delete this question about his ``edits''``.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Actually, I'd like to ask you why you (a) persist in disruption of this page and (b) won't sign in and insist on using so many open proxy IP addresses?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::(a) This is not a ``disruption`` of this page. This discussion pertains deirectly to anyone who wishes to edit this article because if they edit in a manner that  does not agree with, they will likely be harassed and banned by Nescio and his false accusations. People should be outraged that users and/or moderators are abusing thier powers. (b) If I were to sign on under my username, it would most certainly be banned in short order. I wish to see this issue resolved for all parties involved, but I am not willing to risk my status as an editor because of Nescio's frivilous accusations.  `;683;1.0

The problems here such as heavily relying on Chinese sources, inaccuracy in historical facts, copying government propaganda, are commonplace not only in this particular article but most all topics on nations colonized under China. And further, if the current situation continues on Wikipedia, you cannot guarentee the so called NPOV. Not only that will be a joke, the whole Wikipedia thing will end up being another hypocratic, ``civilization`` game. The biggest issue here is the mentality behind the creation of these articles and problems here, hence the debate and this is just the beginning. You have to realize that the overwhelming articles on China-occupied regions on Wikipedia are full of POV but not NPOV. So don't keep fulling yourselves. It's time to wake up now.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThose who're currently in advantageous positions here, are so not because they're intelectually and morally strong but just because their numbers are bigger. They are basically consisted of two types: One types are those Chinese who're either been brainwashed and/or are chauvinistic fanatics. And the other types are Americans who (naturally) have so little knowledge about the world outside of northern America. But then they would have hard time admitting that and therefore, they will end up either pretending as they know or they would simply echo the Chinese POV which is largely circulated and readily available. For them, the famous saying, which goes like if you repeat a lie a thousand times it would become the truth, will make perfect sense. That ``truth``, or what you guys are shouting here as ``the common`` names and stuff, is exactly what is blocking not only your eyesights but as well your human consciousness.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne big difference between the two types though are that the Chinese here do know what they are doing because they have their agenda and they're intentional.

Pretending this proposal is put before a representative audience is tacky, as is the slash-and-burn approach taken in the first place, as is the attempts by MarkSweep to fit me with a gag until the end of UPP (that is REALLY tacky), as is the naked political calculation on my AN/I as to how this speaks for their pet proposal, and how it should be played.  The fact is that this proposal will never have community assent because of its deep flaws, and I am resented for pointing this out.  Tacky is pretending in the face of all evidence that there is a basis for consensus here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: ;2106;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKEN:Just look at several windows at the portal. In one window at the right-hand side you will see ``new article announcement board`` and ``Ukraine-related Wikipedia notice board``. Also, use Portal's own talk page to discuss portal itself. Add all these to your watchlist. Feel free to update any window and, especially, current news. Finally, don't be afraid to screw up. Anything can be easily reverted by you or anyone else. Regards,  July 7, 2005 05:33 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSee Wikipedia talk:Wikiportal/Ukraine re double edit.  7 July 2005 06:46 (UTC).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Wikipedia is not a propaganda machine ==NEWLINE_TOKENI also very well understand what is behind your editings and would like to remind you that Wikipedia is not a propaganda machine. Any wrong information should be removed from the articles and, be sure, it will be removed. This my positive contribution to the Wikipedia. It improves the quality of the resource, because wrong information is much worse than lack of information. If you are not agree and would like put the information back, please folow the Wikipedia_official_policy and cite a cite credible sources. Switch yourself to a constructive work, it will help you to find mutural understanding with most of Wikipedians, including myself. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Couldn't agree more...  NEWLINE_TOKENYou both must really have guts to say this. I mean that's funny who's talking about propaganda machine.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Well, it simply seems that providing no sources when asked to is nothing uncommon in your modus operandi. Or am I wrong? (BTW, no offence intended, just a friendly note).  NEWLINE_TOKENHalibutt, you may turn this into an ethics dispute if you want. I wouldNEWLINE_TOKENonly welcome you or this fellow to start an RfC against me to exposeNEWLINE_TOKENyour unsourced POV pushing and my attempt to resist that to which you respond with personal attacks. As for yourNEWLINE_TOKEN``no offence``, I take everything you said at the face value and I amNEWLINE_TOKENcapable to figure out your intentions from what you say rather thanNEWLINE_TOKENfrom what you claim you are saying.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I merely pointed to the fact that, apparently, I'm not the only person to ask you for sources - as politely as I could - and not the onbly person you ignored, contrary to the good ol' Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:Cite sources rules. If you take it as an offence - I can't do much about it, can I.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHalibutt, how many times do I have to say that this is not about sources. ThisNEWLINE_TOKENis about the liberty you take to interprete them and derive conclusions you favor thatNEWLINE_TOKENare just not there. And never have I ``ignored``. If you refuse to see the answersNEWLINE_TOKENrepeated so many times, I can't do much about it, can I?NEWLINE_TOKENWe can only wait for others toNEWLINE_TOKENagree or disagree whether the answers to your and my conserns are adequate.NEWLINE_TOKENThose ``others`` didn't show up for a while. Still no reason to beleive that theNEWLINE_TOKENdispute was somehow solved by itself.  As for your claimed ``politeness`` theNEWLINE_TOKENarticle's talk page speaks for that. But as for ``offence``, if I were so easilyNEWLINE_TOKENoffended, I would not be able toNEWLINE_TOKENbe at Wikipedia. We all have seen worse than that. It is not for thin-skinnedNEWLINE_TOKENto edit history articles. You should see AndriyK's language he used and even that didn't make me loose my sleep.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Ru Pravda==NEWLINE_TOKENDear Irpen! Sorry if I chose the wrong words for expressing my frustration with AndriyK's behavior. I didn't mean to hurt anybody's feelings. It's just that I've seen a lot of stuff done to a few of my articles that deal with Ukraine's people or geography in one way or another, so I decided to stay away from such topics. I appreciate your hard work in the Russian Portal! Keep it up and see you there.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:If it wasn't done by AndriyK lately, it was probably done by people who aren't on WP for months. Were there any recent incidents? I would love to see more Russian editors helping at UA-portal. In fact I called for that repeatedly as well as to Polish boards. With a few exceptions we never had serious  conflicts. If you can, please do contribute to Ukrainian articles.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Ukraine related topics ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIrpen, I would try to support you, although my knowledge of Ukrainian history is mostly limited to Soviet schoolbooks, and discourse is mostly the imperialistic one. I like your edits better, thou I am not sure if it is the right way to weed out all the Polish names from the cities that were Polish. Would it hurt that much if we would add the third (Polish) name in the first string if they want it so badly?  NEWLINE_TOKEN:No it would not always hurt. It will help in some and would hurt in some other cases. I will explain later, have to go now. Thanks  NEWLINE_TOKEN::I agree with your explanations, OK, lets go into the edit war  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Dear maffiosi, I don't think the edit war is a lasting solution. Perhaps it's time to discuss Andriy's disruptive policies at the Administrators' notice board? During his stint in the Wiki, he didn't contribute anything valuable but spelling reverts and personal attacks on other editors. May we ask to ban him?  NEWLINE_TOKENWe may ask to ban him but, as I told him at his talk page, I was trying to avoid it as much as I could. He violated 3RR multiple times and I showed it to him warning that he may get banned but I never actually proceeded in listing him for banning. Besides, after 24-48 hour ban he will be back even more aggravated and will continue his crusade with even more rigor. He may also find ways to circumvent 3RR or simply stay just under it and this pain will go on. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn the other hand, IMO he've done enough for the full-blown arbitration, which may result in a longer ban. If anyone would want to compile an arbitration case, I will comment on it. But as of yet, I would not start it myself. Several people are trying to talk to him and I hope he would listen. But if nothing changes, he will en up banned for sure.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I think your position is fine. Just one question, is it absolutely, positively provent that OUN authorized the Lvov pogrom and it was not a spontaneus action? If its not 100% proven, we might add some NPOV hedging, like most of the scolars believe..., etc., not just blankly link the pogrom to OUN.  NEWLINE_TOKENI  agree that there are differences of opinions on this. The article provides references that support both versions and both should be mentioned. I explained that some of the sources brought up by this user are controversial but this is no reason to totally dismiss them. What I oppose is that the user simply blanks from the article a sourced version he doesn't like.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Discussion on maidanua.org ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi, I've read that discussion with some interest. Your characterization as ``User Irpen is a very cunning, ingenious, and stubborn troll.`` (``Користувач Irpen - дуже хитрий, винахідливий і наполегливий троль.``) was especially amusing.NEWLINE_TOKENWhat can I say - ці западенці зовсім з глузду з'їхали. Maybe, not all of them, but a significant proportion for sure.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Now you are in danger too ). But seriously, it just hurts. Really, I mean you probably saw what was going on in en-Wiki and had no time to interfere. I took it upon myself to deal with this and I am getting all the heat now. (. And now this slander. I tried all I can to talk to user AndriyK. I was accused in Ukrayinophobia by someone else who retracted it and we are even having a decent correspondance now. But I just don't want to leave something to which I gave so much time. Just check my recent edit history to get a clue. Well, anyway, if I stay I might need help. If you have time, just try to talk to these new people if you can't participate in editing for the lack of time. I tried and I am getting this. Michael tried too. He was not cursed (perhaps because he has an orange ribbon on his page )). Still, he was just ignored. I don't know. If this goes on, we need to engage new editors in productive editing or repell this attack. Or leave ourselves. But this is the last thing I want to do...  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I understand it was very offensive. But you shouldn't worry too much - there are always crazy people out there.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd how do we know he is not paid for what he does? It may be a form of an information war strategy. Similar to specifically hired participants in popular forums, like pravda.com.ua or inosmi.ru. They often pick an active user and start dumping sh-t on him. You would be quite a natural choice.NEWLINE_TOKENN;996;1.0

Come to think of it, I'd much rather see sections of this page describing political blogs in specific countries than have a bunch of small pages on political blogs in each country.  Also, the list of blogs you moved from here to Political blogs in the USA followed the consensus of Talk:Blog that individual blogs should not be linked to (as it creates linkspam and drives an article towards the Spam Event Horizon), only their Wikipedia articles, when applicable.  The Australian article doesn't follow that.    -  ;2705;1.0

But that leaves me no time to write that email. (3) Also, if I would take that time, then Rspeer could delete all my contributions in the mean time, as he already has started to do,  making it hard work again to restore it. (4) I recognize that wikipedia can be accessed any time of the day, but it might be proper for you and Rspeer and others reading my request for a time out to respect my wish for it. (5) Rspeer started  this discussion about my conduct on this talk page, by saying that there was a threat, while there wasn't. Now, do I have to take this seriously ? And have this nonsense here ? (6) Should I have entered my criticism on his behaviour on his talk page, instead of the borda fixed point page, where he occluded the argument on the article with his behavior ? (7) My impression now is that I have to ask for mediation to get some quiet time to formulate my argument on the integrity of science for the professors. True of false ?  ;3908;1.0

43267107;NEWLINE_TOKEN===In an effort to move this forward===NEWLINE_TOKENI have edited a bit in the proposed page.  I must say that I can not find any fundamental problem with it other than that it is far too long and that the battle descriptions should be shortened. If that is not done, there is a risk that newer edits on the respective battle pages will not be reflected in the main article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis does not mean there are no errors or questions remaining about the proposed page.  I am sure there are some, that is normal in an article of this length, but I am quite impressed with the effort spent on the article and the attempt to source.  I also believe it is reasonably balanced.  I have added verify tags where I felt more work is needed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would therefore propose to:  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENa) Replace the currently locked article with the proposed article I linked to above since it is of much higher quality.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENb) Archive this discussion in an attempt to calm things down, and to give those who participated in it the chance to make peaceNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENc) Keep the new article locked, and ask for comments to be made on the talk page to avoid an immediate edit war. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENd) Open the new article once we can be sure that a reasonable consensus has been reached on the talk page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have no idea if these suggestions are in line with Wiki policies, but it appears to me that something needs to be done to overcome the impasse.  That's my 2 pence.  Between them and another 73 pennies you can get a cuppa at a greasy spoon. Regards  ;908;1.0

That I will handle the part of the article ``Sweden democrats respond`` and he give me some slack with that and wont delete it again. Now this other person from Sweden ``liftarn`` again starts to delete the whole section I entered. My guess is that he works for a Swedish organization called Expo that have as its official purpose to work propagandistically against mainly just the Swedish Democrats. The way he argument, the way he aggregates allegations is a pure journalistic approach, not a WIKI NPOV one. I think I can work out an understanding with WeGee (with some help), but with “liftarn” I think it will be impossible. If I am right, and he is from Expo – then its he’s job to be bias.

Why?  The usage policy on Ubuntu's offical site clearly allows for such use. Besides, the logo is just that, a low-resolution image of a logo, which is allowed under fair use.  I am aware that some discussion has been going around about ``fair use`` images in user boxes. If you changed the logo to Tux because I labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*At the time I had changed it, several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy. The Ubuntu trademark policy may allow it, but Wikipedia policy (per WP:FU is to limit images that are not available for commercial use - which the Ubuntu trademark policy explicity disallows.  |  | (contribs)  The preceding text was copied from NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==WP:NPA==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease review and adhere to WP:NPA, WP:CIV, and WP:WQT. Please re(?)-familliarize yourself with Wikipedia policy. Thanks in advance.  NEWLINE_TOKEN*I am fully aware of the above policies, thank you. I do not feel that it can be considered a personal attack, or incivil, to call a troll a troll. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me in that - but that does not mean that my statement is a violation of any of the above policies.  |  | (contribs) NEWLINE_TOKEN*:It is a violation, and you must refrain from it. WP:NPA is non-negotiable.  NEWLINE_TOKEN*::Funny. Nobody considers it a violation of WP:NPA to call  a vandal. Nobody considers it a violation to all  a troll. Why the double standard? Particularly if all I stated was that ``I feel that this user is a troll``? WP:NPA is non-negotiable, but apparently it's open for interpretation, depending on who it is, eh?  |  | (contribs) NEWLINE_TOKEN*:::``Eh,`` again? Anyway, feel free to request another admin to review this instead.  NEWLINE_TOKEN*::::Anyway, believe me when I say that to say ``I feel he is a troll`` is really one of the nicest things I can really say about him. I apologize if it seems to be incivil, but the fact of the matter is - I feel that strongly, and can think of no other way to express that. Without resorting to actual personal attacks, that is.  |  | (contribs) NEWLINE_TOKEN*:::::No need to apologize, as I am not offended. You must, however, attempt to be more thoughtful on how to express such an assessment (``trolling,`` ``resembles the conduct of...``, etc.). If you are unable to think of such alternatives, I suggest you refrain from directing such comments until you are able to do so.  NEWLINE_TOKEN*::::::To clarify: let's say that I feel a certain member's Nazi sympathies/apologist leanings impact their edits and interactions with other users, I would rephrase it in terms of this being reflected in editing practices, et cetera, etc., as opposed to the outright, unqualified personal characterization as as a Nazi sympathizer/apologist per se.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Vandalism to my Userpage ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia Review is not a ``neo-Nazi`` ``Wikipedia hate site``. There are no neo-nazi's on the forum - at least, no open neo-nazis - and it's not a ``hate site`` - it's simply highly critical. You were banned from the site for trolling, no other reason. If you want to hold that as a badge of honor, it's your perogative, but I would request that you at least be honest about it. Oh, and before you call 207.118.103.139 a sockpuppet of Internodeuser, you should do a whois on it. It's a CenturyTel IP, and geolocates to Canyon City, OR. It's not an Internode IP, geolocating to Melbourne, Australia. Seriously.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:It's quite interesting that you know so much about this vandalism. I really don't care if it's Zordrac or not. It's obviously one of the banned users at your little site. I have enough evidence to have the whole IP range banned. Thank you for your assistance.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Allow me to politely point out that you have no evidence whatsoever. You have an anon IP removing some trollish statements from your user page.NEWLINE_TOKEN::Also, allow me to point out that I run Wikipedia Review. By calling it a ``neo-nazi Wikipedia hate site``, you are essentially calling me (and the rest of the members of that forum) a neo-nazi Wikipedia hater - and that could be considered a personal attack. I did not intend to pick a battle with you, or anything of the sort, but I would ask that you calm down. I did see that you tagged this talk page with three templates that had no place whatsoever here - you will see that I removed your blatant trollery, and I would ask that you do not do that again.  |  | (contribs) NEWLINE_TOKEN:::WP:RFCU is that-a-way, .

And how, pray tell, does this give you the high moral ground to complain about blocking on Wikipedia? -  NEWLINE_TOKEN*I didn't ban you - I haven't even checked on the forum or Wikipedia for a couple of days now. I assume this means that Qwerty banned you - I'll have to ask him why when I get a chance.

45629286;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Hello==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI noticed that you have wrote on my talk page. I do know the user McFly85 personally. We both were in a computer lab checking out wikipedia one time and we talked about how the quality of certain areas of articles were a little lacking. He also told me about his tattered history on wikipedia, where he had his user page edited, without consent, by SWD316/Moe Epsilon. Then, someone else vandalized SWD316's user page, and put the blame on mcfly, which I'm fairly sure he would not do. Mcfly did make a few other accounts during a RFA as he was worried that if SWD316 would be given moderator powers, that he would be unfairly banned. And if you look at Mcfly85's edit history, he has made a wealth of good edits, mainly proofreading issues, but also a lot with NPOV, stub sorting, and even creating an article every once in awhile. In my opinion, even with all the alleged sockpuppet abuse, mcfly85 has been a strong asset to wikipedia. If it wasn't for this user, as lot of previous errors and formatting mistakes would have gone unnoticed, and would harm the quality of this site. He had no intention of becoming a moderator, but always intended to improve, even if only slightly, any article that was lacking quality. I feel bad that the actions of Moe Elipson have pretty much caused mcfly, my friend, to lose trust in this site and he has since retired his name. He did come back under another name, and made some great edits, but then, was unfairly (IMO) banned for being a 'sockpuppet used abusively``. There is a difference between being a sockpuppet and trying to use a new name to get a fresh start.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut I am not mcfly85. I am fairly new to being a serious editor on wikipedia, and I was just checking some various parts of the site. I then noticed on the RFAs section that this familiar name came up, and I saw mcfly's screenname in the questions answered by Moe Elpison. I really didn't want other users have what happened to mcfly happen to them, so I voted opposed, which I am allowed to do as a user. I do not feel that I ``unfairly influenced`` the voters, I think the voting results would have been the same weather I had voted or not. And I have never heard of Araxen, and I did not create or am involved with that user. That vote should not have counted. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI just wanted to explain my case to you. I also question that Moe Elipson's user page may be in violation of the no personal attacks policy. He calls McFly85 some very harsh names, such as a stalker. I think that content that bashes other users should be removed, there is no place for that anywhere. But thanks for asking, I hope to keep making solid contibutions to the encyclopedia, it's a fun hobby.  `;2941;1.0

46148639;"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't find your sketch. I agree that this article has huge problems. The biggest is deciding what it's trying to be. I'm inclined at the moment to think it should be about the philosophical side of the question of abiogenesis - Aristotle said it was a self-evident truth, then Pasteur showed it wasn't, but he simultaneously showed that Darwin must be be wrong on theoretical grounds. Kelvin drew attention to a second theoretical obstacle to Darwin, the 2nd law. Miller and Urey (drawing on Oparin and Haldane) then demonstrated that the 2nd law is not an obstacle to the spontaneous emergence of complex from less complex systems. But I'm not sure where to go from there. Some mention should be made of information theory, which is simply a restatement of the 2nd law. I agree that the critics section should go - it's peurile. Not go to any other article, just go. Panspermia in this article I'm not sure about - it's an argument about the details of where life mayn have originated, not whether it could originate spontaneously from non-living matter, which is what I currently see this article as being about. Interesting that Kelvin believed in panspermia, as a possibility. Funny man, Kelvin - no great scientist has ever been so wrong so often. About Pasteur, I think we need to keep this article simple; the nuances of Pouchet et al should be kept for some other article. (Or am I oversimplifying this article?) I'm leaving Wiki now, won't be back, so up to you to do as you wish.  ";513;1.0

46195578;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Help me identify a vandal ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn your RfA page, I see that you are interested in blocking vandals. On that same page on March 17, you forgot to log in once and corrected yourself. Your IP address from this mistake was revealed to be 69.182.48.34. On March 28, someone from that IP address added a note on User_talk:69.182.48.34 saying that it ``is registered to Canterbury High School (Connecticut) and is shared by multiple users.`` The note was added because this address was guilty of previous vandalisms. This information is confirmed by a dnsstuff.com lookup. Canterbury High School is a private boarding school with about 220 students boarding there. My problem is this: on February 12, someone from that IP address entered the new email address for Wikipedia-Watch.org on numerous ecommerce lists, so that the box would be flooded with spam. I believe that if this person was not you, then you at least know who did it. Out of 220 students, how many hang out on Wikipedia? I'm asking you to identify this vandal. What this vandal did is technically a felony. As far as I know, Wikimedia Foundation does not condone felonies.  `;589;1.0

From the day I first interacted with him the guy has had his own little bodyguard squad of admins protecting him just because he's made 50k worth of edits, most of them being page moves and redirects however so I don't see what they think he's added to the project. But I will try for what it's worth. As for stalking you, there is nothing in the rules I've seen that says I can't track your user contribs or SPUIs or Rschen's like I do. I use them as a kind of watch page. If someone would like to point me to where that is wrong, then please do so, otherwise I'll continue to do so as I please.  ;683;1.0

47016188;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOnce again I must ask that you acknowledge that you flagged my edits in error and return my changes to the Moline page, or at least repond to me.  I have been patient but in the meantime I've been researching the wiki dispute resolution steps.  I would rather not travel down that path with you but as we both know you acted in haste and all I ask is that you return my work to the Moline page.  I admit I am not a administrative expert and if an action on my behalf raised a flag on your end, I sincerly regret it, but if you had simply looked at the content I was developing rather than hastily assuming everying was nonsense or vandalism, and removing all of it... none of this would be an issue.

47062772;`, 5 April 2006 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I'll clear this up about my intentions:  I have been told, or glanced over (in passing) several materials purporting the Caribbean slave contribution to the population of Charleston and Savannah (among New Orleans and other multiracially populated areas).  It is also rather obvious about the romantic Pocahontas connection to ideas of Roanoke survivors, in discussions of Virginia.  These things are dismissed as fancy, but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the Melungeon community has had as an inception.  So you see, I am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecks...but I do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the Melungeon identity.  One need not endorse a belief of association, but merely allow others to see what sort of identities Melungeon life has acquired.  I am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in Appalachia.  Appalachian culture is from the Deep South to Maritime Canada.  Melungeon culture is centred on the Gulf coast and south of Bermuda on the Eastern seaboardoriginally Spanish areas.  People think that just because impoverished Scotch-Irish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs, that they were some ``noble savages`` (though they were not Cherokee, but in fact Andrew Jackson's henchmen).  So many ideas here wreak of Crank (person) nonsense.  Are you the spin doctors making apologetics for the Antebellum South, by having it seem like the perpertrators are actually descended from the victims?  Are you sitting in a trailor right now, trying to deny your Jerry Springer lifestyle?  Civil War's Reconstruction is a real bitch?!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat white Spanish territory is the Melungeon core, in true history.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSee here:NEWLINE_TOKENHispanics contributed Melungeon heritage, via Louisiana and Florida colonies.  This was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves.  Melungeons were basically the first Hispanics in the United States, whom often lived in secret or adapted to Anglo ways.  Please, do not spread fantasies as facts in this article!  This work as it is, makes me laugh my ass off at the premise of what it's trying to do!   08:41`;1139;1.0

47474480;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHey glad to hear from you.  This is Jazzy.  Admittedly, I am extremely frustrated with user dcandeto, and my actions have been less than perfect, but I wrote an article for a journalism class on a well known guy named Cody Hedman, and Dcandeto hounded on it until it was deleted.  I felt I did not get ample time to discuss the article before it was taken down.  I admit I made several accounts trying to get around dcandeto.  Firstly, I created Cdub1985 a run off of the guy I wrote about, and then jazzy 006, jazzy 007, and I got my friends to try and keep it on.  Honestly, my attacks against dcandeto have been stupid and anger motivated, and attempting to delete his article was an act of frustration but I do not feel he asserted the importance of the writer he wrote about.  Honestly, what I wrote was not a vanity article, and I just thought it would be cool to have an article on wiki but the way I was so quickly attacked and had nothing explained to me was unreasonable and I retaliated.  You know I treated dcandeto bad, but I feel he should be more understanding and helpful towards newcomers instead of trying to delete work ASAP.  Thanks.NEWLINE_TOKENJazzy.;3701;1.0

47616006;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEddie, the main problem with Wikipedia is that it benefits from the free time of many hundreds of thousands of individuals. So much spare time that it can treat them individually with contempt if it chooses, and get away with it, and not care very much, however much ill feeling that generates.NEWLINE_TOKENIf it had to pay people for the time they input, it would use that time responsibly. But it doesn't have to pay for it. So it doesn't have to manage the resource responsibly.NEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia cares very little how much effort any particular individual happens to put into any particular article. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, all of that effort can just be swept into the waste bin by someone else, the next person who happens to come along, if it suits that other person, and if that happens, it costs Wikipedia nothing, so why should Wikipedia give a damn really? It won't. Wikipedia can smile, shrug its collective shoulders, and say, ``The time you happened to waste isn't a cost to us so we really couldn't care less.`` NEWLINE_TOKENThe system lacks responsibility and wastes the time of countless individuals behind the scenes, and Wikipedia doesn't care about that. Why should it care, if it has millions of individuals as a free resource?NEWLINE_TOKENOnce one understands the system, and one returns to articles and finds that one's contributions have been generally mucked about with to the point where there was very little point in contributing in the first place, and that the essence of Wikipedia is to waste people's spare time, and that people aren't being organised sensibly, the only intelligent thing to do is walk away and not bother contributing. What is the point in carefully drafting things, concentrating on getting everything right, if anybody else is just at liberty to come along and chuck the whole thing out if it suits them? It's a daft system. The system works because you have so many people contributing, but the amount of individual time that gets wasted, and the amount of irritation that gets generated in the process, is, I imagine, collosal.`;1958;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere is the fulltext, from WP:NOT: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Wikipedia is not a soapbox===NEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:NEWLINE_TOKEN#Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a ``sympathetic point of view`` for every article.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: ``Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.``  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small ``garage`` companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.NEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles. That's a commendable position. I'm sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents. Do I understand your position correctly? And is this approach of abstention one that you permanently take? If so, I again commend that position. I trust, as I'm sure you do, that the administrators and the contributors to Wikipedia will maintain quality articles about worthy and reputable subjects.  `";274;1.0

48115242;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn fact, rather than wait, here's my complaint:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo whom it may concern, NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENHi.  My name's Jim Heller and I'm currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with Jossi Fresco.  The background is this.  I am a former follower of Prem Rawat, a/k/a Maharaji, a person I believe is a nefarious cult leader.  Fresco, on the other hand, is a current follower and, needless to say, of a different mind altogether.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENFor some years now, ever since the advent of the internet, Rawat and his followers have engaged in a long-standing campaign to whitewash Rawat's past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history.  The latest flashpoint arose just today when I tried to edit a Wikipedia article of another of Rawat's current followers, a religious studies professor in fact, Ron Geaves (who, by the way, just shot to flashpan infamy as the English academic who opined that the July 7th bombers were ``demonstrators``, not ``terrorists``.  NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENPlease excuse the fact that, to explain the problem in any meaningful way, I have to flesh out the context somewhat.  My edit concerned an academic (not Wikipedia) article Geaves had written where, discussing a program Rawat held in 1973, he wrote that:NEWLINE_TOKENIn November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(My emphasis here and below)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn fact, a widely-disseminated invitation to that same 1973 program, Maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the ``millenial expectations`` but fanned the flames substantially.  Thus, he declared the program the ``most Holy and significant event in human history`` and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA LETTER FROM GURU MAHARAJ JI NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBonn, Germany NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSeptember 31, 1973 NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear premies, NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all, I would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. Because we have realized this beautiful Knowledge which is of great bliss to us all, it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. For it is something they really need. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the world there is suffering, hatred and dissatisfaction. That fact does not need proof. It is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. No one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. The world is looking for the Perfect Master to come and reveal the Perfect Knowledge of God. There is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the Perfect Masters coem to reveal this Knowledge to people. We can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace, for peace lies inside not outside in materialism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs you all know Millenium '73 is being prepared for now. This festival has been organized by Divine Light Mission each year since 1967, in the memory of the late Satgurudev Shri Hans Ji Maharaji on His birthday. This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think that Millenium '73 is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies; and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo do this I really need your help. I really need the help of all the premies in all respects; physically, financially and all other ways to make Millenium '73 come off. This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI hereby invite you to this Divine Festival of Peace, Millenium '73 and request all premies to help me financially, physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of Truth. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIsn't it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBlessings to you all, NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[Sant Ji Maharaj] NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENIt is clear, when you contrast Geaves' claim with the documentary evidence, that Geaves, bless his heart, is playing the role of the typical cult apologist, lying about his leader and blaming the followers, the press, anyone at all, for the inexcusable, laughable excesses of the cult.  What's particularly worrying about Geaves, I'm sure you can appreciate, is that, as a religious studies professor, he's imbued with a certain authority that makes him an especially effective, if unscrupulous, propagandist.  It's one thing when he makes silly comments about the July 7 bombers being ``demonstrators`` not terrorists.  No one would ever take him seriously on that score.  But it's another altogether when he publishes supposedly-scholarly works about his cult leader (without ever disclosing that he's a follower, by the way) which completely distort the historical record.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENWith these concerns in mind, I wrote the following additional comment for Geaves' Wikipedia article:NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENGeaves has written a couple of articles about Prem Rawat, his guru, for various scholarly journals without publically disclosing in those pieces that he is a follower of Rawat (a/k/a Maharaji). Critics of Geaves allege that these works are dissembling, revisionist propaganda and far too biased and inaccurate for proper scholarship. For instance, in a 2006 article, Geaves commented on the ``Millenium`` festival Rawat held in Houston in 1973, noting that ``The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S. with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors. Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations. He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.`` However, in a letter that Rawat himself wrote inviting followers to the festival, he called it ``the most Holy and significant event in human history``. And later, ``This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow you may think that this isn't quite NPOV enough.  You may think it requires more specific attributions.  You may even think it isn't particularly well-written.  But these are all matters which can be discussed and worked on in a Wikipedian collaborative spirit.  Instead, what happened was Jossi Fresco, a paid web tech for Rawat (Maharaji), who stands guard dog over the Rawat articles for his master, anonymously began deleting my text and inserting, instead, this:NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENDr. Geaves has also written a number of papers related to Maharaji and affiliated organizations to combine his first hand knowledge of the subject (Geaves is a student of Maharaji) with his academic training to provide insights into this movement [2]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs indicated on the Talk: Ron Geaves page, eventually Fresco admitted that he was the deleter.  We then got into a big tug-o-war wherein I would reinsert my text and warn him to quit reverting and he would then blame me for reverting in contravention of the Wiki excessive reversion rule.  At one point he siezed on the fact that I posted without remembering to log in (I'm a bit new at this), accusing me of trying to sneak in via a sockpuppet or whatever you call them.  Hardly.  I've never denied my identity which has been apparent to Fresco all along.  Like I said, he was the one who started the anonymous vandalism of my edit before finally coming out of the shadows.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter all this, though, the nub of the issue is this: who was the original editor here and who was performing the illicit reversions?  How can I be fairly accused of too many reversions for simply trying to protect my own original edit against his vandalism?  Believe me, Jossi Fresco is the first to complain when the shoe's on the other foot, namely when someone changes some text this way.  So how can he have it both ways?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI know that Fresco has wormed his way into some sort of admin position with Wikipedia but that's just a potential embarrassment for this institution.  This is just one example but things like this happen all the time with him.  That's why the Prem Rawat articles are so terrible, really.  They have very little substance, their focus is all off and, frankly, they're just boring, whitewashed advertisements for this cult.  And Fresco's largely responsible.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI look forward to your considered reply.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSincerely, NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJim Heller `";81;1.0

Verifiability should always go back to the source, and never otherwise. See discussion there for further edification.NEWLINE_TOKEN:It has nothing to do with Wikipedia related-incidents occuring within articles. NEWLINE_TOKEN:*2) This was a relatively major occurence to Meehan and went to the larger issue of Congressional Staffer Edits. Press coverage should be proof enough. *Shrug*. Sorry its not, for you.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*3) You've just repeated yourself in order to inflate your position. Please reread above item.NEWLINE_TOKEN:*4) You've not only repeated yourself for a third time, but you've ignored the hundreds of press articles—each representing vast blocks of people who do care.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour rant is completely unintelligible.

With all due respect, you may want to consider that leaving hostile edit summaries or comments (e.g., ``rv due to more pissing about by fanboys``, or ``some weird power trip by these people who have ordained themselves as the official Lost wikipedia editors``) don't help your case, and tend to cause others to just disengage.  Please see WP:Civil. I don't mean to get on your case, but I honestly think we'd all get further by continuing to have a civil dialog/discussion on the issues at hand.  I'm sure you have strong feelings on those issues, as do we all, and it'd be helpful to hear your reasoning, rather than have those feelings come out in other ways as you let off steam.  Please take this comment as constructive, because that is truly how it's intended. Thanks.    `;453;1.0

48306153;, 13 April 2006 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Hi Heah, NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Thanks for your reply.  First, I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions.  He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves' relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And here's a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves' revisionism:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions.  However, it doesn't say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three-reversion rule and trigger blocking!  It does seem a little Kafak-esque, don't you think?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Finally, on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco, I do invite you to take some time, if you would, and review his editing of the Rawat articles.  He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13;282;1.0

Innocent until proven guilty. Furthermore, the fact that one of the sources is the notoriously anti-union National Right to Work Foundation calls into question the neutrality and credibility of the author(s) of the article. Also neglected is the fact that the ``owner-operator`` of the snack truck was also a union member of IATSE. I corrected that, but it's further evidence of the ``all unions are evil`` bias of the author(s) of that portion of the article. Jimmy Flynn may well be a gangster and a thug, and the history of corruption in Teamsters Local 25 is, lamentably, true (I speak as a former Local 25 member), but an article that aims to smear the entire labor movement based on notoriously biased anti-labor sources such as the Boston Herald and the National Right to Work Foundation just doesn't cut it in terms of Wikipedia's NPOV policy.

So its full spectrum lunacy here. Trying to control the Wiki. Intimidating scientists who disagree with you. A major cult movement. Which is not to say that his comments on glaciers weren't way out of date and wrong. If indeed he did make them. What happens is that these leftists will follow people around taking notes of every last thing they say. And then if they make one mistake then that's a hanging offence.

The information is not solely from that site, it is also from this one.  I have created a solution to this discussion.  The wonderful thing about Wikipedia is that these changes can always be removed if a concensus is not reached.  As the current concensus is at a stalemate I have taken the appropriate actions.  I am in discussions with regards to the possible copyright infringement, but seeing as Lostpedia currently has no copyright guidelines, I agree this may take some time.  I apologise if you feel that this solution is creating more problems but it was not my intention to create them.

50543144;No such thing as Islamic mathematics NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe religion of Islam does not include math, there is no connection. Mathematicians who were living in regions were Islam was the dominant religion , does not imply that they were Islamic mathematicians . The term makes no sense , but is rather used in some sort of vain attempt at associating the glory of the accomplishments of mathematicians and scientists with the religion of Islam. The fact of studying the Qu'ran makes no impact on one's mathematic ability. The same goes for any other association of a faith with a scientific field. Thus editors who are going around weaving terms like Islamic mathematicians are using Wikipedia as a soap box. ;1229;1.0

51417088;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn agreement would be only if the original editor which was Zereshk would agree someone to change his edits, which he never did, thus it never were any agreement, and his clmains were pure lies, and therefore his constant reverting is vandalism, but i am not here to decide that, the administrator which takes care of the reports does. PS as hardly read the profanities of vandalizers, this time is no different, all i had to do is see moshes name under the comment to look away.

51456353;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``I understand the Fez Whatley is a character on a radio show, but your comments made it sound like they had introduced Jonah as Todd's son.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo, I specifically didn't say that, because that wouldn't be a direct quote. Listen to the show, and you will hear what I'm referring to. For him to make the statement you're looking for, he'd have to come entirely out of character which, even upon a heart attack, did not happen.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Don't insult my intelligence and act like I think Batman is real.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLooking back,I would have replied in the same way. Your spoke as if the character was an actual person, whether you actually believe that or not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Even though Todd plays Fez on the radio, any article mentioning Jonah's father would probably say that he hosts a radio show.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI see precious little about his father at all, and made sure to look for some that would counter what was said on air before making any changes. Like I said before, if there was no information at all, I doubt I'd have changed anything. It was the information I saw that conflicted with what was said that I thought needed correction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``What was said on the show that made you be so confident that Todd was Jonah's father that you ran to Wikipedia to make sure it was on here?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgain, since you seemed to have missed it above, I didn't ``run`` here to add the information. I only ran across this page in searching for what else Jonah had been in. The ``software`` comment was what I found odd. The discussion between Ron and Fez, mostly at Ron Bennington's prodding, is full of references and allusions to Todd being his father. Since you listened to the show yourself, you should know exactly what I'm speaking of. The fact you don't even acknowledge this, has me wondering about your motives.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe only reasons I can think of for anyone to rebut what I've said, considering that I'm only relating what was said, is that Jonah's family prefer this not to be public, which I'd respect, or that people are just trying to support the character of Fez as a person.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've no clue what the reason is, but it's really not worth my time to keep reverting the page.  `;2336;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Now.==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I said. Letsbe civil and discuss thematter in a live chat. I think you will fidn that mroe ocndusive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGiven your current artilc eis a whitewashofher, I do think a better option for you, before yourbanned as a troll, is to tlak to me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIll be waiitng.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==No rellay working.==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe difficulty onthe talk page is yor blatant willignness to decieve others abotu me usign the same tactic you claim I use againt Acharya. You claim that I am a covert Zelous Christain wantign to defame her, and you merley wish to defend the truth. We both know this isnt true James. You want peopel to beelive her ideas and are willignto do anyhtign to make her seem as imprsive as possibl an rmeove all oposiiton to her vies.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy Chrisytaintiy is sued asa blundgeoon. You make it osund as if I oppose Acharya base don my faiht, hate her, and vehemntly opose her, and htus want ot attakc her. You then claim the aritlce is written in sch a way that it attakcs her. No spacific exampels of attakc are shown gowever.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI can assure you, nothign ithe article that is the current ocncensus among the general posters ( As oppsoed ot the Acharyans) is derogatory towards her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut yo wish to rmeove the links ot CHrisyain rebuttals and all critisms.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf Dorothy wants to attack Chrisgaunity, why has she then no supply of courage to stand up to their rebuttals?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMidn you, Im not th eon makign suh a rebuttal. THis is WIkipedia, and I am ever midnful fo the need tobe Unbiased. Thoughyou will nto accept hat form me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is why I think talkigto me on Yahoo woudl be mor eocnductive. Uou would not only getot know me,but also ge tot have liv interaction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENthis wya, we can easily discuss, in real time, any and very issue.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe baords you wher invited ot to demonstrae you rown abyslam lack of undertanidng baout both Christendom, and myself. My invovlement on that baord shos how open midned I can be,a s itsamonght emost inclusive baords you can go. THe invitaitonstands alays, butthe raon I want you their now is to demonstrate how little bias their is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have fairly rtepresented Mromons, Catholcis, and Jehovahs witnesses. I haveeeven defended Elpidio and MyMindCore when they are misrepresented.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlternate beelifs that disagree with me are discussed, not shunned. But what I have low tolerationfo is misleadignpeopel.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDOrothy is not a Historian, rleigiosuscholar, linguist,or archeologist. NEither is she anyhtign of particular note in academia. This si a fact, not a disparagy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHer primary claim to fame is her wbsite and correlated books.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis makes ehr as I am. A proffesional writter, not an acadmic. (thoughIm enerign Acadmia.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLikewise, As noted,and as you cansee for yorselfif you rmeove the filter, nothgin ibthe articl condmens her.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is nto my way to condemn beelifs. But her acitosn, and yors, are condmend. You attemot to coerce Wikipedia into complaince to present an image that she desires presetned. This cannot stand.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd htus, my invovlement. After all, it is my article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENZarove/NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==James reply==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN**forgid me for a minor edit. Wan tot keepthis orderly so moved yor reply.**NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENZarove,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think our differences are best discussed on Acharya's talk page. Perhaps I will drop by the Christian forum when we're done here.  JNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Invitation.==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is perhaps best to direclty spak. If you have Yahoo messenger, Id be glad to discuss our diffrnces.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think that, once tou becoem better aquainted with me, you will see that your objecitosn rent as solid as you owudl beleive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgain, also, theiris a standing invitaiton to The Christain FOrum.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou may psot their. We have Ahtist, Christain Yahwists, andnayhtign elseyou may like. Its open to all.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut I will extned an invitation to Yahoo messenger. If you have htis device on your PC. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy address is Zaroff3.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==TO JAMES==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is clear that you and Acharyas other disiples ar eliek her in many ways. Willign to lie, manipualte,and distort to get your way, and quiet willign ti exagerate, and use Ad Hominim attack, while at the same time projectign this on others.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou omit ( Forno reason) the life informaiton, whichis acutlaly the most impotant and yet underdeveloped, aspect of the aritlce, and remove the Critissms. The Critisms are because you want her views presente dunopposed. Ihave no idea why you dont liek the life informaiton, excpe thtat itsirrelevant for the soread of your beleifs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd htis is the core of it. You want her to look as brilliant as possible. An accredited schoalr, a Historian, linguist, religiosu shcilar, and archeologist.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou want others ot mock me for my claims ( WHich I have acutal accredition for) abotu beign a Physics major once, a Journalist, and other thigns. Yet, I didnt even brign these up, you sdid. I acutlaly do hodl a Masters in Jorunalism. I rellay did work at a paper. I rlelay do now work as a researchder. I did take a year and a ahlf of Physics courses because Im interested. But neither is relevant here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, rather than smear me, which is only a ruse to silenc me so you can gain contorle over the aile and thus write it to your mistress's satisfaction, it pwiudl be more hoenst if you left is alone. I asusre you Im nto a covert Christain operative, and the aricle was nto wrtittn to smear her. As evidence, read the aritcle withotuthe Acharya FIlter. No part of it condmensany of herviews, and hasbeen subjected to numeous peerr reviews here at Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI didnt concemn her for her advicationfo Entheofgens for instance. ( DIspite hr own misrepresentaiton that the artilce did.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLiekwise, my own Christainbeelifs arent as fundamentalist as you present. Look athte baord soemtimes. We have Elpidio. Hes a Christyain Yahwist. Thusfar he's denied the Virign Birth, claiemd Jesus is not God, and removed books form th cannon fo the Bible, whole adding soem other books. He's an administrator, just liek me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe have MyMindCore. An athiest. And a Moderator.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe beelifs are varied their and we tolerate all views. This of corusedoesnt serve your ends. So just clal me a Christain fundy out to desotry Acharya. Lie for your mistress. COmmit the same crimes those evil Christains did to desotry Paganism in ``The CHrist COnspiracy``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHypocracy runs rampent, and I grow tired of it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you want the truth, then why not create an EZ Account and post on the CHristain FOrum.

However, we Russian wikipedian society, found that out AFTER he already deprecated the tag, and used his admin powers to edit a media wiki page. So were we, according to him supposed to simply watch our work disappear, yes it sent me into a frenzy, because this is not the first time he completely ignored us. The original TfD was much criticised for not keeping the editors that use this tag informed prior to its nomination. However now he goes further again with blatant ignorance.

53292971;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN said it a year ago, and I'll repeat it: this article is embarrassing.  This is Wikipedia, not Everything2; readers shouldn't be bombarded with a debate they most likely have no interest in.  Check out the Sodium page  it's nasty stuff, and we eat it every day, yet there's no sodium controversy.  A bad example?  Of course, just like this page is a bad example of a Wikipedia page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSince the controversy aspect now takes up the majority of the page, yet is peripheral to the subject, I am forced to disagree with 's strategy of merging the Water fluoridation controversy page back in to this one.  A ``section consisting of a paragraph or two summarizing the debate and linking to the other article`` is by far the more professional way of structuring this page.  50 years down the line, when the requisite research has finally been done and the controversy is settled, one side or other is going to look somewhat foolish.  Being more of a centrist, I don't really mind so much, but we can all work towards decreasing the embarrassment by following sound Wiki practice and not throwing cream pies around where innocent bystanders might be hit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENComments on this position are welcome.  `";220;1.0

53631073;`Shuki: Well I am glad to see that you are up to speed on everything Wikipedian! Here are some of my reactions to your comments: UserPZFUN says that he is an admin on his user page (which I did look at before the critique), see: Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/PZFUN. Is that a lie? Nowhere do I accuse him of anti-Semitism (I see that you enjoy twisting around words...hmmm, what a pity.) While User:PZFUN may well be a lover of Jews, that does not mean that he gets a ``free pass`` when he does a weird thing to an article about a well-known rabbi. You may not know it or accept it, but the word ``goy`` or ``goyim`` is considered to be derogatory regardless of what you tell your non-Jewish pals in chat rooms (again more habitual word-twisting on your part I guess.) What's ``NOR``? I cannot read your mind. I don't accept any of your thinking about how to handle articles that we know nothing about.

Here are some of my reactions to your comments: UserPZFUN says that he is an admin on his user page (which I did look at before the critique), see: Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/PZFUN. Is that a lie? Nowhere do I accuse him of anti-Semitism (I see that you enjoy twisting around words...hmmm, what a pity.) While User:PZFUN may well be a lover of Jews, that does not mean that he gets a ``free pass`` when he does a weird thing to an article about a well-known rabbi. You may not know it or accept it, but the word ``goy`` or ``goyim`` is considered to be derogatory regardless of what you tell your non-Jewish pals in chat rooms (again more habitual word-twisting on your part I guess.) What's ``NOR``? I cannot read your mind. I don't accept any of your thinking about how to handle articles that we know nothing about.

I am currently writing to you from my place of work, located in Boston, Mass, USA.  I have chosen to perform this unorthodox experiment from my workplace, in order to avoid negative votes on my possible upcoming election as an administrator, on the Wikipedia username I use from home.  The main purpose of this experiment was to know, first hand, what vandalism “feels like,” from the vandals’ point of view.  Let me tell you, “I have learned a lot” NEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENI appreciate how you all quickly reverted vandalism and left welcoming warning messages in the beginning.  When I continued to vandalize “Wolf” I appreciated how you all “Assumed Good Faith.”  However, Kim van der Linde, at times you forgot to stay “As cool as a cucumber.”  I especially admired Radio Kirk’s reaction and cool persistence with the block he initiated.  His direct quoting of the complaints of others was a smart move.  I also liked how you all continually to welcome me to Wikipedia even though I was annoying the ^&%$ out of you.  NEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENSo, to recap, the recent problems caused by than account were done on purpose, as an experiment by me, in order to find better ways of combating vandalism with my other Wikipedia account.  I thank you all for you response and for now I’m signing out.  If anyone else uses the ip to access Wikipedia in the future, please regard them as a new user, as I don’t plan on using my work computer to access Wikipedia in the future.

They are also widely known as guineahens, (a term formerly applied to the turkey).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is an African family of insect and seed-eating, ground-nesting birds resembling partridges, but with featherless heads and spangled grey plumage. The Helmeted Guineafowl has been domesticated and introduced outside its natural range, for example in southern France and the West Indies. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGuineas are monogamous, spending their lives with the same mate. They lay 25-30 eggs in a deep, tapering nest. Their eggs are small, and dark. The hens have a habit of hiding their nests, and sharing it with others until large numbers of eggs have accumulated. The incubation period is 26-28 days, and the babies are called ``keets.`` They are highly susceptible to dampness (after all, they come from drier areas of Africa) and can die from following the mother through dewy grass. Though, after their first two weeks, they can be some of the hardiest domestic land fowl. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSexing the birds is not as simple as telling a rooster from a hen chicken. When they are adults, the helmet and wattles of the male are larger then the female, and the female is the only one to make the two-note cry ``Buck-wheat!`` Aside from that, however, the two sexes are mostly identical in appearance. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs domestics, guineas are valuable pest controllers, delighting in ridding your yard and garden of insects. They are especially beneficial in controlling the lyme disease carrying deer tick, as well as annoying wasp nests. While they are rarely kept in large numbers, a few are sometimes kept with other fowl to be used as a security system against hawks. No intruder or stranger will get past the eye of a guinea, and they will call, loudly, with their high shrieking voices. They are highly social birds, and hate to be alone. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWithin the domesticated species, many color variations have been created aside from the ``pearl`` or natural color of the helmeted guinea. These include White, purple, slate, chocolate, lavander, and coral blue.

54560876;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Let me take this in a bit at a time, okay? The first thing I understand is that opponents of FG regard the teachings to be ``homophobic``. And depending on one's definition of homophobia, we can pretty much see where that would come from. As many people use the word, ``homophobic`` can mean simply ``opposed to homosexuality``. It can also, however, mean ``irrationally opposed`` to it (having no reason which makes sense to any sane person); or, working actively to suppress it (as by legislation); or, ``afraid of homosexuals`` (refusing to work with them, crossing the street to avoid gay bars); or, ``hates homosexuals`` (beating them up, telling snide jokes about them, refusing to rent, etc.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::From what little I know - basically Wikipedia and a few random bits of googling - FG's critics are using ``homophobic`` only in the first, minimal sense. They complain that FG opposes gay sex as a karma-producing behavior.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Are you going a bit further and asserting that FG's anti-homosexuality teaching is also ``irrational``, ``fear-based`` or ``hateful``? If so, it would be good to provide a source for this (other than your own reasoning). Surely there's a civic leader (or cultivator's son!) whom we can quote.  `";2154;1.0

55173038;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLarry Sanger has the same diagnosis that i do. I have more to offerNEWLINE_TOKENin terms of how to solve the problem. But not whilst being blockedNEWLINE_TOKENby trolls and their pet admins for making the effort.NEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKEN``Wikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENConsequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to ``work with`` persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet. As it is, there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project (though there are some, of course) than there could and should be. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt will probably be objected by some that, since I am not 100% committed to the most radical sort of openness, I do not understand why the project that I founded works: it works, I will be told, precisely because it is radically openeven anarchical. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI know, of course, that Wikipedia works because it is radically open. I recognized that as soon as anyone; indeed, it was part of the original plan. But I firmly disagree with the notion that that Wikipedia-fertilizing openness requires disrespect toward expertise. The project can both prize and praise its most knowledgeable contributors, and permit contribution by persons with no credentials whatsoever. That, in fact, was my original conception of the project. It is sad that the project did not go in that direction. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne thing that Wikipedia could do now, although I doubt that it is possible in the current atmosphere and with the current management, is to adopt an official policy of respect of and deference to expertise. Wikipedia's ``key policies`` have not changed since I was associated with the project; but if a policy of respect of and deference to expertise were adopted at that level, and if it were enforced somehow, perhaps the project would solve the problems described above. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut don't hold your breath. Unless there is the equivalent of a revolution in the ranks of Wikipedia, the project will not adopt this sort of policy and make it a ``key policy``; or if it does, the policy will probably be not be enforced. I certainly do not expect Jimmy Wales to change his mind. I have known him since 1994 and he is a smart and thoughtful guy; I am sure he has thought through his support of radical openness and his (what I call) anti-elitism. I doubt he will change his mind about these things. And unless he does change his mind, the project itself will probably not change. ``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt isn't the people per sey, its the way  that they manage to interact, the simple lack of Logic and the defensibility of ignorance in a vaccuum.

More to the point is that in general, what I enjoy about Wikipedia is much more creating articles than deleting them; arguing over what should or should not be said is not rewarding for me.  The participants in these arguments (including myself) are always hugely dismissive of the topics they oppose, as is true of any asynchronous Internet communications, but they are only ever justified in this in the case of the most frivolous or deliberately fraudulent articles.  I often find myself defending material which is being attacked as ``unencyclopedic``, but which I think is important to any writing on mathematics.

See the section called ``Examples``. This is where they frown on words with ``some`` in them. Its not my opinion, so I'd rather copy and paste as it were, then ramble about why I personally wouldnt use it. Its not what I believe, its what Wikipedia allows. But as you request, I'll ``articulate``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The word ``some``, is broad. It can refer to a number of ``things``. This however, is poor usage of words. As I have noted above, it leaves a large number of questions, more so, than the first question the reader has when looking for this article (whats a scottish rite?). Plus, its not allowable on Wikipedia. So I agree, and am disputing it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I bring up bias, because it is. It gives the illusion of an NPOV (neutral point of view), but isnt. And when its not an NPOV statement, its a POV, which is bias. And support of such a statement, shows it. And gamesmanship...no.

56484456;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::: The less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is ``British & Irish Isles``. Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the U.K. as a protected and supported territory, Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the U.K.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDid you read the article on wiki about the basis for usage of the term? NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENCompletely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles. Place names reflect current realities, thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople. NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENA better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now ``Greek islands`` are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated ``Greek`` are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENThus, you could not refer to the island of Ireland as British.`;2864;1.0

56510893;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Hate speech is serious, Mr Malber.  As I recall, your involvement with Wikipedia Review was because you were guilty of hate speech, in that you suggested that ``people with autism should not be allowed to edit Wikipedia``.  Malber, you are a poor person to comment on such an issue.  You should have been banned from Wikipedia for your comments, yet here you remain, continuing with your hate speech.  You are quite correct that Amorrow engaged in hate speech, although of a lesser variety of the kind used by you.  He was banned, as you were.  You, Malber, were banned for hate speech.  Did you forget this?  Perhaps you forgot this.  The place that is the only place devoted to criticism of Wikipedia is indeed important.  You can disagree with as much of it as you like.  Criticism, by its very nature, is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of.  This does not illegitimise it.  There are many and varied very legitimate criticism.  One such criticism is why a hate-monger such as yourself is not banned from Wikipedia.  Perhaps you are biased in this however.  Perhaps you'd like to argue how you are less of a hate speaker than anyone who has ever posted on Wikipedia Review.  As far as our evidence has proven, you are much worse than the worst on WR.  Yet here you remain, free to post on Wikipedia.  Strange that.  `;823;1.0

I never opposed to your contributions, I requested that you present your propositions but the only time you came up with something it was clearly tainted with opinions. I proposed you to resubmit other propositions and that I will neutralise them for you, I even emailed works, this is evidenced from the talk page. You then claimed not having time but had all the time needed to answer others. Don't blame your lack of contribution on anyone. And do you remember when I have called you? Does Torque ring a bell? I requested few simple things from you and it was to abide by the rules, you always refused and will protest them in the talk page. If you follow the archive you will see that I too protested at the beginning but finally understood that Wikipedia is a community with specific rules which make it run and prevent it from chaos. You seem under the impression that I make the rules. Why don't you present all your propositions I was opposed to to any veterans and see if there is a single one that will find them acceptable? Your beliefs about my intentions regarding you are simply and plainly paranoia, my citation about you and NPOV had nothing to do with what you claim. I simply present the condition of the article and the people involved there, I have never started talking about your psychological states never had I slandered you, I simply said that you had still to understand NPOV, can you claim in anyway that this is not true? I have even presented my misbehaviors. But all I recieved from your part is backstabbing and threatning to present my strategies against socks which are totally unrelated and are against none of the policies and guidelines.

The Authors of this page have insrted so many bias and unfactual things into this article, it's no wonder Wikipedia is looked down on by Schools, and professional historians. If Wikipedia is ever to be credible, these authors need to put aside thier pathetic ego's, and allow others to help edit these pages with sourced facts...even if the facts are contrary to the bias of the original authors. I will edit this page daily, and I will inform Wikipedia about the unprofessional behavior of the editor's of this page, who revert and discard any changes to the article, no matter how well sourced or factual they are.;3621;1.0

I have seen Fenriswolf's posts in the Asia and Japan regional boards, and from the nature of them he seems to be a loyal, unquestioned admirer of the Chinese communist government. Myself however, is an Australian citizen. Although I do not oppose the Chinese government, I support eventual democracy in China, and can at least acknowledges its negative aspects. If I was indeed a mindless follower of the Chinese government, then why didn't I remove entire sections of articles such as Falun Gong and Epoch Times regarding negative aspects of the government? I reverts some of TJive's edits due to his choice of wording, such as his insistance in calling certain governments ``regimes``, and his tendency to edit without discussion, dismissing me as a stooge of the Chinese government on his user page.. If you look at my edit history, I do not delibrately start any vandalism or edit wars, and has contributed lots to science-fiction and videogame related articles. It's unfair to judge me as a vandal based TJive's hearsay, as I do not have such resources this Fenriswolf person claimed, other than my home computer.

57565507;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I would like to point out that there used to be a great deal of, in my opinion, very unnecessary fighting over terms such as ``circumcised`` vs ``unmutilatedcastratedstabbedpenismurdered``. NEWLINE_TOKEN::Isn't it advisable, to at least be able to use a more scientific sounding vocabulary - as in, detached from everyday speech and associations to avoid emotions. Synonyms like that are an important part of an article when stuff is looked up primarily by text search - if relevant words are missing, the article fails as a whole. Dictionaries are never complete, and neither is Wikipedia. The advantage of Wikipedia being, that we can update her ourselves as new information becomes more widely available. IAR2TR.  `;1619;1.0

57609623;`NEWLINE_TOKEN::There was I thinking you people wouldn't care about ``the real world`` and preferred ``reliable sources`` (that you get to pick and judge) instead! Despite the term not being very widespread, it is used in the ``real world`` of people trying to sound scientific about the state of circumcision and the adoration thereof - see the links. ``The real world`` is thus exactly an argument why the synonym should be mentioned in the article. Spreading information is the purpose of wikipedia. Here we have a synonym for being circumcised belonging to an article that is in desperate need for a richer vocabulary about that state. Remember the ``circumcised vs natural`` wars? That problem would be reduced if there were actually more words - outside gym shower room talk - to describe the state of circumcision. Addition of the synonym (and subsequent, occasional use) would be without a doubt beneficial to the article as a whole.  `;3302;1.0

57802689;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGuys, it's just simply me that put there Moldovans (Romanians) 78,2%, and I was not logged in, and don't give quickly the fault on Bonaparte, he's gone from longtime now from this bullshit of Wikipedia, 'cause there's no purpose with hypocritic people like you. I modified that, everybody knows that that's Moldovans and Romanians are the same shit, anyhow the census will say it. They speak Romanian, and not Moldovan how they sustain. A Romanian understands perfectly when a Moldovan is speaking it's fuckin' language called Moldovan, and vice versa. Moldovans are doing this because they are a gang of betrayers and retarded that don't have idea what's their ancestry. Let's be reasonable now, even if I think that you people here are too stupid to understand this. They were Romanians until 1940, and suddenly they changed of ethnicity because they are an different country than Romania.   ' 10 June 2006;2687;1.0

If the pages are not representative of what many believed Mohammed looked like, what is the problem? I mean, our own western potrayals in artistic form of Jesus, be them Byzantine, Catholic or Protestant are not lifelike representations, and never can be, but they offer invaluable insight into the way Jesus and the events he went through were thought of in these societies.

58414573;NEWLINE_TOKEN:Hi Niall / ,NEWLINE_TOKEN:There appears to be some consensus on that page that commercial links can be included (and there is nothing specifically against commercial links at the relevant guideline). However, the point of external links is to provide further information for the readers (they are even labelled as such in the Automatic number plate recognition article). Clearly in many cases, some of the larger commercial companies hold more extensive and authoritative information about the technology on their websites than can be included here. However I could not see that the link you inserted provided this additional information. The link appeared to have been inserted only to promote the company - and this is not what the links are for. I'd encourage you to study the external links guidelines and spam policies further - inserting links to your own company is especially frowned upon. Please understand this is not about the size of the companies or the profit they make, but the size of the information they offer in relation to what can be included in Wikipedia articles.    ;2580;1.0

58629135;`NEWLINE_TOKEN=== Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. NEWLINE_TOKEN:If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. NEWLINE_TOKEN:So do the wisest, just shut up! NEWLINE_TOKEN:It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. NEWLINE_TOKEN:All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. NEWLINE_TOKEN:You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. NEWLINE_TOKEN:As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. NEWLINE_TOKEN:They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. NEWLINE_TOKEN:So if I take the name ``anonymous`` as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? NEWLINE_TOKEN:I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? NEWLINE_TOKEN:It is all a lie. NEWLINE_TOKEN:How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? NEWLINE_TOKEN:It isnt equality it is power struggle. NEWLINE_TOKEN:It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. NEWLINE_TOKEN:WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:HA HA! NEWLINE_TOKEN:Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as ``logic``. NEWLINE_TOKEN:For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I speak 9 languages: NEWLINE_TOKEN:English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. NEWLINE_TOKEN:As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. NEWLINE_TOKEN:2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. NEWLINE_TOKEN:That was for learning a foreign language, sister. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Oh! I forgot, you are a man, difficult to know with a pseudo! NEWLINE_TOKEN:I found it superfluent but wi;3162;1.0

58682392;`NEWLINE_TOKEN::::According to your logic, reverting vandalism would be disruptive too, and should lead to blocking.  I think the problem here is that, like many admins, you barely contribute to Wikipedia, and care little about its content.  You are mainly a janitor and policeman, and tend to develop a janitor's and a policeman's attitude.  It is an issue of systemic bias.  Ordinary users tend to have an editor's attitude, i.e. their priority is making articles as good as possible, and not accept other people's bad edits.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Your mention of discussion on talk pages is fantasy.  Oh, I do of course discuss matters on talk pages at great length (look at this for example), but I am under no illusions that people like you or Eiorgiomugini will be swayed by any amount of logical argument.  At the end of the day, the only way that editors can make sure that articles have good content and not bad content is by inserting good content and removing bad content.  This is my observation after long examination of Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::In the specific case of me versus Eiorgio, your mention of discussion is also a straw man because you are trying to imply that I only discussed in the edit summaries.  In reality, I tried to reason with him on his talk page, but he simply deleted all my comments, showing he had no interest in debating it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Your mention of sockpuppetry is fantasy and a straw man.  Please do not introduce irrelevant, insulting concepts into the discussion.
