This makes no sense, and it had been agreed by all editors that the Welsh are among the closest ethnic groups to the English, as anyone familiar with those two peoples knows. Your argument appears to be that the Welsh should not be included because they are English - as a result of the 1536 legislation that annexed Wales to the English kingdom. I can only assume that you have no idea what ethnicity actually means, and I suggest you read the article about it. In short, ethnicity has nothing whatsoever to do with legislation, and the mere annexation of Wales to England did not extinguish Welsh ethnic identity. But you don't need to take my word for it, just look at the Welsh people page. And nor, incidentally, is ethnicity dependent on race or genetics. You have accused me of being a racist, but it is you who are the racist by insisting that ethnicity is defined by race. As for Danes and Norwegians, their inclusion is arguable (though not so much the Swedes - very few of them settled in England). The agreed consensus prior to your unilateral intervention was that no Continental ethnic groups would be included, on the grounds that the inhabitants of the British Isles are much, much closer to each other in terms of culture, history, and language than any groups from mainland Europe. Again, this fact is obvious to anyone who knows them. As a Canadian, it is possible that you may have been ignorant of this.

This is not only false, it is also completely irrelevant.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStill further down you have completely mangled the section dealing with the Norman Conquest and its effects. You have deliberately suppressed the historical fact that the English became a conquered nation, and inserted irrelevant descriptions of coats of arms. You then suddenly lurch into a (false) description of Neolithic Britain and Gaul, as if this was in any way relevant to the Norman Conquest. You then mention the Roman Empire and one of its short-lived breakaway states, jumping straight to Offa and Charlemagne, desperate to clutch at any sort of straw that will lend support, however flimsy, to your own preconceived notion that no distinction should be made between the English and the French (despite the obvious fact that these two peoples have a very different language, culture, and ethnic identity). Your mention of the consolidation of kingdoms around capitals such as Winchester and Paris is also completely irrelevant, and your suggestion that the English Channel has been the main focus of English cultural development is demonstrably wrong - the North Sea has been just as important, usually more so.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMoving further down still, you have inserted a whole new section entitled ``Royalty``, and it is here that you expose the full extent of your total misunderstanding of (a) what the article is about, and (b) the English people. English identity is not based on coats of arms as symbols. If you want evidence of this, look at the World Cup, being played in Germany as we speak. The English fans, almost to a man, carry the flag of St. George, and only very rarely the Union Jack. They never, ever carry the royal coat of arms in any form. Being Canadian, I suspect that you have received a rather distorted view of the English through Holywood depictions and the like. The vast majority of English people would laugh in the face of the sort of mediavalist aristocratic fantasy that you are espousing. You then go on to claim that all Englishmen are actually descended from royalty! This is patent nonsense, and once again exposes your own royalist fantasies. The medieval French-speaking monarchy deliberately did not interbreed with its English-speaking subjects. Now, I'm not saying that no genetic material from earlier monarchs exists in the modern English population, but that is not the point. Statistically, every single person on earth might be descended from Julius Caesar, or anyone else you care to name who lived long enough ago. Oh, and French is most definitely not a lingua franca used among Englishmen - we don't need one, because we've already got English. Indeed, English people in general have been notoriously bad at learning foreign languages. And all that guff about what Scottish and Irish people think of this, that and the other is not only POV, but also completely out of place in an article about the English people.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo sum up - by your own admission you are a Canadian of French ancestry. Nothing wrong with that of course, but it means that your view of the English may not be at all accurate, and this has been proved by your ill-conceived alterations to this article. The English and French, for all their geographical proximity, are worlds apart when it comes to culture, language, and ethnic identity. As a Canadian you might lament this fact, but Anglo-French identity in Canada is something for Canada to sort out, and you have no right to try and impose it on the actual English and French themselves. If you really want to make constructive additions to this article, then try and learn something about what the English are really like, and stop relying on medieval fantasies. You clearly have some sort of personal axe to grind, but I'm afraid that Wikipedia is no place to sort out your own ethnic insecurities.

Recent British Republicanism should not be confused with precedent and connection, which is largely based on a recent influx of Bolkshevik (or what, Jacobin a la French Revolutionaries? How surprising!) ideology as a result of the Cold War. To be English is to be anti-Communist, as exemplified in the James Bond films. This guy thinks he is a ``True Englishman``, but he gets it wrong almost every time. Subjects are forbidden from using the royal arms without permission, but it is a symbol of ethnic identity traditionally found throughout Europe. He has Bolshevik fantasies, as evidenced on his various edits to Wikipedia articles in which he shows disdain for the survival of our common monarchy. He tries to remove French as the Englishman's lingua franca, but how often do Englishmen or Anglo-Americans not visit France and mingle with the people for their chief/number one international experience? He asserts that my descent from John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster is just a Mediaeval fantasy because the ancestor is Anglo-Norman and preposterous that the majority of Englishmen who have royal descent is from that man just happens to be irrelevant to the Plantagenets breeding with their subjects. You think that ignoring the Scottish and Irish about their objections to a close identification with the English are irrelevant, yet they are based on a series of English conquests of their lands and replacement of their identity. You hypocritically think that is a moot/negligable point, but not in the French case towards Englandwhich was more organic in every sense. How have the Celtic languages affected English?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:What on earth is an ``organic, symbiotic relationship``? You are exposing your royalist fantasies yet again. In fact, a monarchy is a system of government, and like any other it has its advantages and disadvantages. When the people tire of it, they replace it with so;248;1.0

Nobody tells them that the plane wave approximation is only an approximation and that it is, therefore, completely useless to 'prove' something ia a context of paramount importance. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe nonsense of the 'non-existing classical Doppler effect' spreads in the literature since Einstein published in 1907 a short note, where he had stated that the transverse Doppler effect, which already Stark wanted to measure (why, if it is unknown in classical optics of moving bodies?), is ``important``, but not that it is ``unknown`` in classical physics. It apparently has to do with the hystery which seems to capture most people who get in touchNEWLINE_TOKENwith the special relativity nonsense.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn reality SRT departs from classical optics of moving bodies solely for the case of longitudinal observation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis I was going to demonstrate in the article Modern Galilean relativity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBecause of your unprofessional interference with that article I stopped today contributing to it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSince you have the big mouth and know everything better, I suggest that you finish the articleNEWLINE_TOKENnow. `;854;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Aryan Anarchism==NEWLINE_TOKENMy dear   I was wondering if you could explain your behaviour. First you remove the section on Aryan Anarchism with the comment ``(xenophobic marxism etc - not notably anarchist sorry deletinh 'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right)``,. The section was restored with an addition to the section discussing Aryan Anarchism on the talk page inviting you to explain your somewhat bizarre comment. Bearing in mind Lala Hardayal's prominent position as an academic philosopher and Stanford University, involvement with the IWW and eventual departure from the USA following his arrest for his anarchist activities, your suggestion that the piece is not notably anarchist is hard to understand. This is compounded by your final quip ``'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right``. Perhaps you could explain why you regard the self-organisation of migrants against repressive immigration control? For that is certainly a feature of tehir involvement with the voyage of the Komagata Maru. Is it odd that this movement, as with every other anarchist movement, throws up contradictions. I think not! Did not Peter Kropotkin throw in his lot with Tzar and encourage Russians fight Germans as a war against the state. Was not Pierre-Joseph Proudhon a patriotic anti-communist noted for his sexist attitude to women. His anti-semitism is matched by that of the pan slavic nationalist, Bakunin. Skirting around the section on American individualist anarchism for sake of brevity lets dash to the Anarcho-capitalism, the reference to ``Steve Booth's work in the UK publication Green Anarchist``, the whole section on (New Right) Post-left anarchy, or the puff for the insignificant academics David Graeber and Andrej Grubacic in Small 'a' anarchism. Some how all these escape your attention, and you hone in on this short piece on Aryan Anarchism. Is it too much to ask why? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Is still non-notable.. more so than Anarcho-capitalism and American Indi anarchism.. that's why i homed in on it. 'Aryan anarchism' is simply absent from all well-regarded books on anarchism     NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Whilst I agree with your reversions, please pause for a minute see if someone else will revert the page if  reverts again.

59518090;`:::The point, Luna, is the repulsion I feel in reading the racial & religiously vilifying views of a bigot such as Sumple (views which are self-confessed and unretracted). Note that these views are much more recent than 10 years ago (that was a lie by Sumple, which you fell for). In fact, it doesn’t take a moment to figure out that as they are on Sumple's personal pages (linked from Wikipedia, can you believe it), that they are his current views. He could log in to geocities and remove those pages in about five minutes (if he wanted to).NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I gave Sumple fair opportunity to renounce his odious writings – something he chose not to do. Obviously he doesn’t wish to retract his offensive opinions.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Having seen that, Luna, it should be clear to you as to why it is critical that other Wikipedians be given fair warning about the sort of influences that might be present whenever Sumple begins to edit articles (in a neutral and encyclopedic medium such as Wikipedia). Remember that I'm not just warning the Wikipedian community of something petty or minor (say Sumple's problems with grammar). Sumple’s views are subject to the Racial Vilification Act 1996 (NSW), and I would hate to see articles in Wikipedia brought into disrepute on that basis. ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing``.

In fact; archaeology confirms that the Bretons left Britain as Salian Franks were among the Nordic invaders when Rome fell.  TharkunColl says that the Normans aren't related, but you say that the Channel Islanders do not constitute a separate ethnic group.  Where is the consistency of logic in those assumptions, which defies consensus outside of your joint control of this article?  Things are much different in the wide world of academia and scholasticism.  Well, Channel Islanders speak a language closer to English than any Celtic tongue.

Wikipedia is not a vehicle for these types of POV; these Balkanist notions.  When discussing ethnic relatives, the Channel Islanders are a mutual bridge between the English and French.  This is confirmed by all academics and scholars; that you two fringe-theorists disagree is of no consequence to the world at large.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You might be interested to read this discussion (begun by Mwalcoff) on the administrators' noticeboard.  The emerging consensus seems to be that your usage of the image may not be de jure proscribed by WP:USER (and may not, to most of us, be at all unsettling or offensive) but that the image, rightly or wrongly, appears to be serving to disrupt (or, at the very least, to inhibit collegial collaboration) and that it might be decorous of you to remove it.  Feel free, though, to interpret the debate differently...  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe thing about the picture is that people do not expect to see it on a talk page. Therefor it shocks them. I am wondering why it is you want the picture on your talk page in the first place? It is certainly an unusual thing to do. I think you need to either remove it, or at least put some sort of explanation next to it to explain to people why you have such a picture on your talk page. To Mwalcoff this picture illustrate a wikipedia article - so it is not going to be deleteted.  |  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've removed the two duplicates from this page as it seems to me that they were just there to anger those feeling offended in the first place. Likewise placing vandalism templates on people's talk pages who remove the image also serves only to escalate the dispute rather than resolve it so please don't do that. Also don't insert the picture on other people's talk pages. if they are unhappy about you have the photo on your talk page then it must be obvious to you that they will not want you to put it on there's no will they? It is much better to actually talk to people rather than dismiss them. Cheers  |  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've fixed /header to remove the picture. In my opinion this is an absolutely crystal clear case of vandalism.  Any similarly malicious edits will get you a block.

Readers of Wikipedia aren't required to be familiar with all of its policies and guidelines, and so it can't be assumed that they will know about the notability requirements, which are in fact only a guideline.  Moreover, there are plenty of organizations which don't go out of their way to publicize themselves yet are still notable, and aggrandizing connotates way more than just publicity.  Including 'self-aggrandizing' doesn't at all suggest that that's their primary motive.  As well, there could be notable trolls or notable trolling groups who don't self-aggrandize, and certainly not to the extent and in the joie de vire manner the GNAA does.  Indeed, many trolling groups and individuals try to obscure or hide the fact that they're trolls, which often makes their activities more successful.

60779626;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Responce==NEWLINE_TOKENI am JimJones005 and I just wanted to say that User:67.101.77.46 just coppied and pasted my warning of his(her?) vandalisim of the takeover article onto my user page. I don't know why editors insist on punishing people who make good faith edits to add to wikipedia with warnings and the deletion of their facts. We all might disagree sometimes, especialy since anything Non-Dom always seems to get deleted, but I hope you will understand. I'm going to re-insert the so called vandalism back in there tomorrow, and if you, or anyone else reverts it, I will call upon an admin. I like to think that you were just confused as to what was actualy going on, and happen to be on the wrong side of this insident. At any rate, sorry for the misspellings (native tongue is Hebrew).   ;3551;1.0

61513044;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== quite inflammatory, right? ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI was not discussing that to cause an argument. How could you know? Are you a psychic? NEWLINE_TOKENAgain, I use IQ (i.e. the value I estimated) as a criterion for assessing the user's ability to be an admin or his ability to produce a valid vote on RfA. It is a nonsense, but  I find the criterions for most of the oppose votes equally laughable. And I didn't disrupt wikipedia to make a point, thus I didn't violate WP:POINT. I have the same rights as the other editors, and saying that ``he didn't pass my IQ test`` is not the same as if I was saying ``he is stupid``, thus this is no personal attack. Pure logic, if I say a didn't pass my test because it's not bigger than 10, it doesn't mean that a is lower than 5. Thus, a feels offended only if it wants to feel offended. Got that?   `;2390;1.0

61653761;NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::Well as I said we shoudl agree to disagree on this.  Policies are still editable, if you are going ot make major changes you do need to get a consensus on the talk page or you will be reverted but it has and does happen.  Your refrence to OR totally misses the point though as its a question of weater verifable statments fomr a group of people can be used as a refrences about statments bade by tha group of people or not.  So it is a question for WP:CITE not WP:OR, but like I said we can be quite happy not agreeing on this point and more relavent is the issue at hand.  Speaking to that, I have also been able to verify that any registered SL user can edit that wiki (seems I just needed to log in and then go back there).  That said there are only two editors of that file the first has the lst name Linden though I dont know if non-employess can use that lastname.  Also the diff between the two versiosn shows nothing, unlike you I do not think the polocy is clear on this issue but since it is not 100% claear and because its trivia I am not prepared to fight over it.  |  ;2997;1.0

62150867;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Westside==NEWLINE_TOKENYou recently deleted my article on Westside, because it was not ``verifiable``. You said that I needed to have Westside reviewed by newspapers, or something along those lines. My problem with this is that it is not a, um, well known publication, and as such would not likely be reviewed by any newspapers or such. Is there anything I can do (or in other words, what kind of external sources do I need?) to get my article back on Wikipedia? How can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a website to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no website to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought ``What better than Wikipedia?`` Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside? Also, why was my article initially cited as an attack article? It seemed obvious to me that my description of Tucker and Jason were not in any way insulting, as their apparent lack of intelligence is a character trait. Thanks in advance for your response.`;1133;1.0

62432434;`NEWLINE_TOKENIt might be argued that it is YOU who has the ``agenda`` by completely removing the ENTIRE paragraph then making an attack such as you did in the history section accusing people of slander. This is NOT my intent. Fine, you win. I'm not going to participate in this section anymore. It's not worth all this aggravation. May I suggest, however, that you take a look at the wikipedia profile for say Jim Morrison of the Doors? There is a large section dealing with Morrison's personal life, some of which is unsubstantiated, but no one sees fit to go in there and expurge entire sections and then accuse others of having ``bad`` intentions. So what if Manilow is or is not gay? Does it make him a lesser musician? absolutely not. Johnny Mathis is gay and it hasn't hurt his fan base.  Other stars are straight and it doesn't change a thing. I think that an emotionally mature fan is not afraid to discuss ALL aspects of a celebrity's life. but I will not be coming back here since you see fit to make unwarranted attacks on the characaters of other Wikipedians as you did on Arnie and myself.

62478879;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:What I mean by offensive, guys (and BTW I don't share that view) is that British Isles is used very often in as a subtext for British which offends many people (and not just Irish people) who don't view themselves as British and find the implication that they are as offensive and demeaning to their own nationality. Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989 caused considerable offence to Irish politicians when he misinterpreted the claim that Ireland is part of the British Isles to mean that Ireland is part of Britain (ie, the UK). Some asshole in his Foreign Ministry told him that Queen Elizabeth was the Irish head of state, presuming that the British Isles = the UK. When an annoyed Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, told him bluntly that the Queen has nothing to do with Ireland, Gorbachev apparently asked ``so why then do you call yourself part of the British Isles?`` Haughey at that stage lost the head and growled ``we fucking well aren't. The Brits keep calling us that. And then people like you keep thinking we are part of Britain.`` As far as the Irish are concerned, we are no more part of the British Isles any more than Belgium is still part of Holland. It doesn't bother me much. (Heck. Look at all the stuff I write about the British monarchy.) But it does offend a lot of people. Nancy Reagan, again hearing that Ireland is part of the British Isles, put her foot in it when she asked how often the Royal Family visited Ireland. She was told that they didn't (they do now, but not then) and said something along the lines of ``But you are part of the British Isles. Aren't you linked to the Royal Family?`` A more diplomatic Garret FitzGerald simply told her that we had had nothing to do with the British Isles and the Royal Family since 1922. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Similarly, people regularly say that U2 are from the British Isles, therefore they are British.

That is I fucking R fucking I fucking S fucking H. We have nothing to do with Britain, nothing to do with the British Isles. We are Irish.`` That is why references to the Republic of Ireland being in the British Isles is such a sore point. People hear British Isles and think that means part of Britain, ruled by Britain, or with the British queen as our head of state. Which is why, for millions of Irish people, when asked if they are from the British Isles, are likely to say ``fuck off``. Theoretically British Isles may be officially a geographic term, but in practice it is used to refer to politics, culture, history, identity, you name it. Irish people are fed up saying ``we are not British``. They then go ballistic when the next question is ``but why then are you in the British Isles?`` The response of most people is ``we fucking well aren't.`` \ `;1667;1.0

This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic ``learn to breed`` guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html.

The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic ``learn to breed`` guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake. You can't through bad human crosses in the trash like you can with corn.`";2930;1.0

The worst of which I can be accused is attempting to correct disinformation, sometimes a bit impatiently. (On the other hand, when editors of the CTMU article were falsely and maliciously accused of forging source material - that is, personally attacked, and repeatedly - nobody said a word, and no moderator lifted a finger. Clearly, something's not right there.) Regarding the Mega Society, I'm afraid you're on your own. I'm not interested in it or its Wikipedia article. If it is associated with Langan or the CTMU, that may well be a shame...but if the truth be told, probably more so for Langan and the CTMU than the Mega Society itself.

Just because someone with initials after their name managed to get something published, or posted something on the net, does not make it good science. ``Encyclopedic`` should mean both ``known and recognized as good``   and ``comprehensive``; but ``known good`` should always trump ``comprehensive``.  The vandalism (e.g. ``more pictures``) is also out of hand.

65197192;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Jdorney really needs to grow up here. ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst off Jdorney, I keep it up, because you are ingnoring facts which I have continually provided proof for. I have submitted to you, the site, sources, page numbers, and even posted the actual articles in which these facts are stated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEither you don't bother to read them, or you read them but ignore them because you are so biased in your beliefs that you only include facts that support them, and in some cases you lie altogether. How in god's name you are allowed to continue to be a Wikipedia editor is beyond me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou basically quote two sources in the PIRA article...CAIN research, and Lost Lives. CAIN research is a ``estimated`` source of information. Jane's Intelligence, the US State Dept, and the Council On Foreign Relations...all use official statistics for their information, they do not ``estimate`` casualties as CAIN does.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for Lost Lives...I have the latest edition of that book, and if you go through it page by page, you come up with the Loyalist casualty figures and British Security Service figures, i have put in the article. Either you are not really reading the book, or your are just lying about the figures, because you know they don't support your beliefs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou also misquote other books. For instance ``The Irish War`` staates that 46 Loyalist Paramilitaries were killed by the IRA between 1986-1997...you state in your article that this is the TOTAL number of Loyalists killed by the IRA, that isn't true. The IRA killed a further 38 Loyalists between 1974-1986, but of course you leave that part out. I don't know if you are some Loyalist sympathizer or what, but the way in which you continually ignore the facts about how many UDA and UVF members were killed by the IRA seems odd to me. I have given SEVERAL different sources for this number. Books like ``The Irish War`` or the latest edition of ``The IRA A History`` by Tim Pat Coogan. Jane's Intelligence, the US State dept. ``Patterns Of Global Terrorisim`` and the Center For Strategic and international studies. Why these highly regarded sources aren't enough for you, I am not sure...unless you are trying to push an agenda.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll of the above sources agree on the number and breakdown of the British Security service people killed bu the IRA over the 30 year war. As a former US Marine, with experience in Counter-terrorisim issues, I pride myself on using the above sources, which were the same sources we used in our Force Recon, counter-terrorisim classes. And by the way, the IRA was one of the main groups we studied, along with groups like Hezbollah, Al Qaida and the Tamil tigers. These groups are known as the ``big four`` to the US Military.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf the above sources were good enough for the Marine Corps...they are good enough for Wikipedia. You need to grow up, and stop deleting facts just because they don't support your own, sad, bias views.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI will file another complaint with Wikipedia about you, and I will continue to edit this article to ensure that it is professional and not the work of some biased little editor, who is more interested in pushing his own views then he is in the facts.`;2149;1.0

65377282;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Well, I'm sorry, but I don't have those links that you desire. Yes, this article is very POV based, in favour of vangard propaganda sociology. Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth. Left wing politics can be just as dirty and obfuscatory as right wing politics. - CaptainSurrey`;3737;1.0

Progress on the entire set of articles is on hold pending the outcome of this checkuser.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::This is ridiculous. I'm here trying to create a better encyclopedia and this is the support I get? Hell of a turn off.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::While there are about 1000 administrators on wikipedia, only 14 of them have checkuser permission and 99% of the cases here are answered by just two of them, so you may have to be patient.  No article is so important that the sky will fall if it is stuck in the ``wrong version`` for a few more days.  You can try a request for comment on the article to get some outside opinions if the usual editors can't agree.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Sounds like this system is broken. Only 2 of the 14 people actually do the work? Time to replace some people. Or put some kind of disclaimer that this isn't very timely. Something to let people know not to expect results.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN I'll be damned if I'm going to put up with that kind of abuse.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:How about judging it on it's merits rather than your personal feelings?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN, seconded in the strongest possible terms. And CovenantD blocked for 24 hours for disruption.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm just coming into this, but that seems more than a little harsh. Can't wikipedia have operational disagreements without assuming it's personal attacks, resulting in blocks? Or is there something outside this discussion I'm not seeing?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I think the cascade of abusive comments directed at the checkusers were more than enough justification for blocking for disruption; common sense says you don't come ask for help and then start taking swings at the people you're asking for help. By the way, just for future note by anyone watching, the reason that it takes a while to get a response is because we have to deal with things like this; if people were, you know, patient/pleasant/appreciative, then we might be a bit more inclined to run checks. As it stands, we gain very little but constant abuse from all sides for volunteering our time to do this.

65575328;"`(Moved from User page, oops, should have been here in the first place)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have nominated your article for deletion since it goes against WP:AUTO, WP:Vanity, WP:POV, and the whole idea that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a place for any schoolchild to make up flamboyant stories about themselves.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Your email ==NEWLINE_TOKENYou have no right to do that. Firstly, I'm not Antony, secondly, I don't even like the guy, thirdly, its all true. What right do you have to just assume something is made up? I don't go around flagging other peoples work when I feel they are either misled or ignorant on a subject. How about you take your Cambridge degree and stuff it up your arse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStarting from your first point - I have utter right to do that. Every time you edit a page, you put your contributions under the GFDL; underneath the edit box is a note, in bold, as follows:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease note:NEWLINE_TOKEN*If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe page on Antony Phillips, whether or not it was you, was non-encyclopaedic. If you're not Antony and don't like him, then why are you putting up an article that lights up his antics? Why was that the only subject of your interest at Wikipedia? Why are you defending the deletion of that page at all? The page was utterly full of positive spin; many of the links that attested to his notability were redlinks (``Full Metal Blazer``? The entire thing sounds like a spoof, for drama class at school. That is NOT worthy of inclusion in a worldwide encyclopaedia; the phrase gets one single (myspace) hit on Google. That is nowhere near famous. That's so antifamous it's pathetic), and his current notability was listed as ``famous simply for being famous``. That is utter and total bullcrap. I assumed it was made up because of the way the page attempted to portray the subject as famous; while the subject of the article is an unfamous schoolboy. Whether or not it's true isn't even relevant; the page simply isn't notable. The subject of the article is not worthy of having an encyclopedia article. If you're not Antony, you shouldn't even care.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNote also that I flagged the article for deletion - I didn't flag it for speedy deletion, I put it to the vote of the Wikipedia community. You didn't get any supporting votes; an admin then speedy deleted the article because it had no support. Wikipedia is used as a reference site by many schools, and combining that with the fact that a lot of you are bored/mischievous/etc, we get pages and pages and pages of crap. So much that guideline pages are written about it. When an article is about a student, and contains no notability other than assured notability within that school, then it is not going to survive. Whether it's me or someone else that flags it first, it's going to go.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you believe that the article should be reinstated, then go and contest it. Cite your sources. Add references. Make it sound remotely believable rather than made up. Then it might survive nomination for deletion. Better yet, find something else and make it better, like you did with the Abbey Road article. That'd be welcome.

65575328;"`(Moved from User page, oops, should have been here in the first place)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have nominated your article for deletion since it goes against WP:AUTO, WP:Vanity, WP:POV, and the whole idea that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a place for any schoolchild to make up flamboyant stories about themselves.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Your email ==NEWLINE_TOKENYou have no right to do that. Firstly, I'm not Antony, secondly, I don't even like the guy, thirdly, its all true. What right do you have to just assume something is made up? I don't go around flagging other peoples work when I feel they are either misled or ignorant on a subject. How about you take your Cambridge degree and stuff it up your arse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStarting from your first point - I have utter right to do that. Every time you edit a page, you put your contributions under the GFDL; underneath the edit box is a note, in bold, as follows:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease note:NEWLINE_TOKEN*If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe page on Antony Phillips, whether or not it was you, was non-encyclopaedic. If you're not Antony and don't like him, then why are you putting up an article that lights up his antics? Why was that the only subject of your interest at Wikipedia? Why are you defending the deletion of that page at all? The page was utterly full of positive spin; many of the links that attested to his notability were redlinks (``Full Metal Blazer``? The entire thing sounds like a spoof, for drama class at school. That is NOT worthy of inclusion in a worldwide encyclopaedia; the phrase gets one single (myspace) hit on Google. That is nowhere near famous. That's so antifamous it's pathetic), and his current notability was listed as ``famous simply for being famous``. That is utter and total bullcrap. I assumed it was made up because of the way the page attempted to portray the subject as famous; while the subject of the article is an unfamous schoolboy. Whether or not it's true isn't even relevant; the page simply isn't notable. The subject of the article is not worthy of having an encyclopedia article. If you're not Antony, you shouldn't even care.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNote also that I flagged the article for deletion - I didn't flag it for speedy deletion, I put it to the vote of the Wikipedia community. You didn't get any supporting votes; an admin then speedy deleted the article because it had no support. Wikipedia is used as a reference site by many schools, and combining that with the fact that a lot of you are bored/mischievous/etc, we get pages and pages and pages of crap. So much that guideline pages are written about it. When an article is about a student, and contains no notability other than assured notability within that school, then it is not going to survive. Whether it's me or someone else that flags it first, it's going to go.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you believe that the article should be reinstated, then go and contest it. Cite your sources. Add references. Make it sound remotely believable rather than made up. Then it might survive nomination for deletion. Better yet, find something else and make it better, like you did with the Abbey Road article. That'd be welcome. Especially - take note! - those where you can go around flagging other peoples work when you feel they are wrong. Make it right yourself - or flag it so someone else can correct it if you're not sure. The template  is good for this if you know something's wrong with a page but aren't sure how to fix it yourself.

65590622;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Hi, Rick Norwood. Funny but I find just the opposite to be true. Badly written edits, i.e. blatant attempts at removing meaning from articles, are mostly done by left-leaning (socialist, modern liberal, etc.) editors. Also, the large majority of editors, and not suprisingly, admins here at the wiki, are socialist and in general left-leaning and are dominating many of the political articles. The meaning of words, the correct charictarization of ideologies, and history itself, is being altered. This article is a prime example of this aricle take-over and the propaganda that is being strongly pushed here. I predict it will be the downfall of Wikipedia. This is sad to me because, what could have been a free and inclusive collaberation of knowledge, has been turned into a giant machine that spits out non-fact, censorship, and well, just plain propagandistic cow flop. Sorry if that sounds harsh. That's what I see. I love Wikipedia and would like to see it be, once again, what it started out to be.  `;3789;1.0

66123529;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy Wikipedia Can't WorkNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia claims (or is promoted by its users as) a replacement for the traditional encyclopedia. They frequently compare themselves to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but in reality Wikipedia is not an adequate substitute, let alone a replacement. What's more, because of fundamental problems in Wikipedia's philosophy, design, and operation, it would appear impossible for Wikipedia to ever become such a substitute. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are many problems with Wikipedia, some more important than others. I'll discuss only two that have bitten me in the past. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Ignorant Edit-BullyNEWLINE_TOKENMany people have noted this phenomenon, though I've never seen a good name for it before. In a nutshell, the problem is that a person knowledgable in a given field (but not a regular Wikipedia contributor) notices an obvious error in a page devoted to a topic in that field. They want to be a good citizen, so they edit the page and correct the error. However, within minutes, their correction has been reverted, restoring the error, and if they're particularly unlucky, they may receive a note from the person that reverts their change, accusing them of ``page vandalism``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt seems that there are a large number of Wikipedia devotees or zealots who have little more to do than hang around the Wikipedia site, watching for edits to pages that they've contributed to. Any change to ``their`` page is taken as a personal insult and instantly reverted, regardless of its merit. What's worse is that the types of people who do this simply do not have the knowledge or intellectual tools to recognize the merit of the contribution. They would appear to typically be young people, perhaps in their first couple of years of college. They have the headstrong ignorance of the young adult, coupled with an insecurity complex that makes them unable to accept that others might have something to contribute that they themselves lack. In ``real life`` they would be harmless, as they wouldn't be able to stand up to others in a confrontation, but the anonymity and isolation of the internet give them the confidence to become overly assertive. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo an expert makes a contribution, sees it discarded by someone who obviously has no qualifications to judge it and all the time in the world to get their own way, and the expert simply leaves, never to contribute to Wikipedia again. The quality of many of Wikipedia's articles clearly shows this phenomenon; reading through the edit history of many pages shows it in action, graphically. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo Editors Means No Sense of the ValuableNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia prides itself on not relying on professional editors, which they claim makes Wikipedia more egalitarian. However, egalitarianism is not necessarily a desirable quality in a reference work, as the philosophy of everyones contributions being equally valuable is simply untrue in the real world. As Theodore Sturgeon noted, ``ninety percent of everything is [crap]``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis leads to the problem of many of the Wikipedia articles having been created or primarily edited by the ``edit bullies`` described above: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThey do not necessarily have a broad knowledge of any of the topics they write about. NEWLINE_TOKENThey are generally not well-read or broadly-educated, having little context for the particular areas they have studied in any depth. NEWLINE_TOKENThey tend to have concentrated their reading on various things of personal interest to them, so they have no sense of proportion or of what is truly significant to the world, versus the trivia that was important to them as teenagers and such NEWLINE_TOKENThis results in the Wikipedia in general having laughably large holes in the areas it covers, while having an even more ridiculous amount of spurious detail on subjects that it has no need to cover. My current favourite example: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany Wikipedia articles about important historical figures are little more than caricatures, if they have sufficient details to even be called that. Many other important figures are simply not mentioned in Wikipedia at all. A number of months ago, I looked for information on an important North American manufacturing industry figure from the 1980s; he could be considered the most important business person of the decade. I was somewhat shocked to see that there was no article about him at all. Note that I am not identifying him by name; this is because Wikipedia tends to react quickly to correct specific faults only when those particular faults are widely publicized, in order to render that particular critique null. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, being a good naive contributor, I created the article. I noted who he was, why he was famous, a few of his most important accomplishments, and I properly notated the article as being a people-related article stub, hoping others would help flesh it out. A few weeks later, I checked back, only to find that the article had been c";920;1.0

LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome of the cabal must have jumped in, looking at the edit history, maybe because they were smarting when I pointed out their ways. LOL. I feel bad for them, they must have been nursing their grudges for long. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour message in my support and other messages have been deviously deleted by one of the cabal. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENWould you be bothered enough to put it in place again?NEWLINE_TOKENThe cabal obviously want to paint the issue their way. HAHAHAHAHA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI did not read a single message on my usertalk page after your nice supportive message because I already knew it must be full of the cabal's unmentionable things. LOL. I only noted the names of the cabal and had a big laugh.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA few things did come out of the incident.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCrossmr meekly submitted that he had not blocked me.NEWLINE_TOKENHe further admitted in so many of his own words that he had not even read the message Vesther had sent me to which I had replied, and that he had no idea about the issue, but he still sent me 1 warning and 1 message, LOL. Even after warning me and sending me another message, he did not have any idea about the issue and had not read about the issue at all!!! LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENHe further did not even warn Vesther, but he warned me for using those words, Vesthers words, which I only used to reply to him in his own medicine.!!! LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, the result is that Crossmr has succeeded in showing himself to be UNFAIR, BIASED and grossly INCOMPETENT to be an admin. Who makes these guys admins??? LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for Mr. Royboy, LOL. The less said about him the better. LOL. HAHAHAHAHA.NEWLINE_TOKENWho made this guy admin? Where did he come from? Who IS he?NEWLINE_TOKENWhat explanation did he give for blocking AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME?NEWLINE_TOKENMe and Crossmr were just talking about his warning, which u know by now was totally wrong and biased, he was not even aware of the issue and gave an excuse of tralala, which Vesther had used!!!, and this guy turns up from nowhere?NEWLINE_TOKENIt was a total and absolute DISGRACEFUL abuse of admin priveleges. Too bad I foiled it.NEWLINE_TOKENI guess he only knows how to block people without reading a single word of what people write or even understanding the issue. I sympathize with his condition.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome people do get obsessed and have control issues with wiki I guess, Vesther being a case in point.NEWLINE_TOKENIs it possible that this guys a friend or a sock-puppet of an earlier aggrieved cabal member? LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway, the above two examples are on record, and you are the witness!!! NEWLINE_TOKENAnd I hope next time you act strongly and correctively on such issues, I mean un-blocking.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI guess this petty cabal must have been going about this, just block, without any warning to block, and without understanding or reading anything about it, with other people, before they came across someone like me, LOL. And after that they try and make excuses and dig up old irrelevant issues which they couldnt muster up before that, as excuses. They must be quite experienced in trying to obfuscate the SPECIFIC ISSUE IN QUESTION later on. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI sincerely think that you should have exercised your right to unblock, seeing how u understood the issue, and the concerned admin or admins had no expanation for the block.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo reading, no understanding of the specific issue, no warning to the original guilty party, no warning to block, just block!!!! LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut Now, they will think hard before going on about their murky ways.NEWLINE_TOKENLOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, by extrapolating this, I have come to the conclusion that wiki is seriously and morally challenged and also lacks in competence. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll the more reason its needs me. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wont let you down wiki. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOf course, there must be many good decent admins like you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA few words about my messages I had sent.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWith regard to Vesther, we both know what I feel about him. HAHAHAHAHA. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENBut to be fair, its not his fault really. Its the incompetent power-mad admin's fault who probably hit buttons from a list before even reading the messages of both parties. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVesther just couldnt take it I guess after I repied back, giving him some of his own medicine, he just started crying. LOL. I guess he's not used to it. Maybe till now people just got bored of his obsessive ways and ignored him. LOL. Too bad. I see he has been receiving some much needed counselling from his best friend Crossmr who Did Not give him a warning for the very same words. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd he has further archived the discussions. Hmmmmm. Not a bad idea, when do u think I should archive that now-useless page, as it is I dont use it after I created an account. Anyway.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs to my own ways,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou dont know how much I was chuckling continuously after I inadvertently read some (parts of) messages while posting from proxies (to only legitimately protest and not to damage wiki's articles), after getting blocked, saying that it had all caused quite a bit of drama. I really did not want to crack the whip, but ...!!!! LOL. (even this terminology is borrowed). LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSomeone, u know who, was desperately trying to block me to prevent the truth about their actions from coming out. LOL. The petty cabal must have been trying to rustle up support. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am still smiling and chuckling because of it all. Drama! HAHAHAHAHAHA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not egotistically proud of defying the ban, but in the case of such a wrong ban, which could not be justified, I felt in hindsight it was the right thing to do.NEWLINE_TOKENIn fact, I was not even aware of smashing the ban at that time, I was just busy posting my messages!!!!! which some people were trying hard to prevent me from, for obvious reasons. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd I left only after I had made my point and I had nothing more to say.NEWLINE_TOKENObviously, nothing malicious was ever intended or done using proxies, it was just a method of registering legitimate protest. Wiki has a noble intention, and I support it, inspite of the cabal. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn fact, I also wrote a meaningful(I think, LOL) line in the Dalai Lama article, to symbolically break and defy the utterly wrong block, Gandhi style. Dont know if it was saved though, as I said I was quite bored by then.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs it is, the block had no meaning, and I was always in cruise mode, surfing and free to edit if I felt like it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for my messages which some ppl found uncivil. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll I can say is that it was never pre-emptive. I was only replying to them in their own tone and medicine. Too bad they couldnt take it. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd it seems that one has to watch the language even while talking to third parties, because big brother is always watching. lol. DUCK. lol.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a newbie, people should first of all post an extensive list informing them about so many rules!!!! LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese ppl probably expect all newbies to be aware of what wiki is about and all its rules right from the start, even though some people just surf into it from google while searching stuff etc. and think its all about just putting and editing in their views etc. and expecting others to do the same!!!!! NEWLINE_TOKENAnd thats what they keep doing, until suddenly they get some weird vandal warning, warning them and stuff, and expecting them to know all the rules. LOL. Amazing. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd even in the first warning they dont post a nice message saying, hey, here are the rules, please follow them and help make wiki a better encyclopedia. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENAnd they dont even say that u cannot edit or delete the stupid warnings!!! LOL. Its all quite ridiculous. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThey should be trained to be nice to newbies, as policy, because they are admins! LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI doubt if any newbie knows about user talk and rules and warnings and warnings about warnings, or whatever. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut knowing the cabal I dont blame them. LOL. They must need newbies to have something to do. HAHAHAHA. Block and stuff. LOL. HAHAHAHAHAHA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI guess newbies must be given powers to block such admins too and strip them of their adminship.NEWLINE_TOKENTwo newbies should have the vote to unblock, and also to block such admins after arguing their case.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe admin(s) involved in the above incident would surely be blocked and stripped of their adminships by now. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDo you think I should waste anymore of my time on these petty people to strip them of their adminship?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI too can rustle up quite a cabal if I get to it. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut I pity those guys and think I probably have set them on the path of being good admins. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENSo, I wont waste anymore time on them. LOL. I am not into all this stupid bureaucratic unmentionable anyway which looks like has become quite central to some people's existence. NEWLINE_TOKENDo admins get paid? Or is it all a labour of UNBIASED CONSIDERATE ALTRUISTIC love? LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENAll these stupid serious rules. LOL. But seeing these admins, maybe there should be some rules to control them. Someone should admin the admins. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOr maybe I WILL complain, to put the fear of Jimbo into them. LOL. Or perhaps to make them to be HONEST, UNBIASED AND COMPETENT. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd yeah, Im not being egotistic or anything, you know the facts, even you know thats RIGHT.NEWLINE_TOKENYou know what side the Truth lies on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway Sue, knowing how you supported me after knowing the facts and the issue, I really appreciate it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are kind and generous.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for the cabal, they have only confirmed my;553;1.0
66245358;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Hey Sue, How are u. from u know who==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHey Sue Anne, how are you?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHope you are as fine as always.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLooks like the petty cabal has been upto something on my IP userpage. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome of the cabal must have jumped in, looking at the edit history, maybe because they were smarting when I pointed out their ways. LOL. I feel bad for them, they must have been nursing their grudges for long. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour message in my support and other messages have been deviously deleted by one of the cabal. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENWould you be bothered enough to put it in place again?NEWLINE_TOKENThe cabal obviously want to paint the issue their way. HAHAHAHAHA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI did not read a single message on my usertalk page after your nice supportive message because I already knew it must be full of the cabal's unmentionable things. LOL. I only noted the names of the cabal and had a big laugh.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA few things did come out of the incident.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCrossmr meekly submitted that he had not blocked me.NEWLINE_TOKENHe further admitted in so many of his own words that he had not even read the message Vesther had sent me to which I had replied, and that he had no idea about the issue, but he still sent me 1 warning and 1 message, LOL. Even after warning me and sending me another message, he did not have any idea about the issue and had not read about the issue at all!!! LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENHe further did not even warn Vesther, but he warned me for using those words, Vesthers words, which I only used to reply to him in his own medicine.!!! LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, the result is that Crossmr has succeeded in showing himself to be UNFAIR, BIASED and grossly INCOMPETENT to be an admin. Who makes these guys admins??? LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for Mr. Royboy, LOL. The less said about him the better. LOL. HAHAHAHAHA.NEWLINE_TOKENWho made this guy admin? Where did he come from? Who IS he?NEWLINE_TOKENWhat explanation did he give for blocking AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME?NEWLINE_TOKENMe and Crossmr were just talking about his warning, which u know by now was totally wrong and biased, he was not even aware of the issue and gave an excuse of tralala, which Vesther had used!!!, and this guy turns up from nowhere?NEWLINE_TOKENIt was a total and absolute DISGRACEFUL abuse of admin priveleges. Too bad I foiled it.NEWLINE_TOKENI guess he only knows how to block people without reading a single word of what people write or even understanding the issue. I sympathize with his condition.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome people do get obsessed and have control issues with wiki I guess, Vesther being a case in point.NEWLINE_TOKENIs it possible that this guys a friend or a sock-puppet of an earlier aggrieved cabal member? LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway, the above two examples are on record, and you are the witness!!! NEWLINE_TOKENAnd I hope next time you act strongly and correctively on such issues, I mean un-blocking.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI guess this petty cabal must have been going about this, just block, without any warning to block, and without understanding or reading anything about it, with other people, before they came across someone like me, LOL. And after that they try and make excuses and dig up old irrelevant issues which they couldnt muster up before that, as excuses. They must be quite experienced in trying to obfuscate the SPECIFIC ISSUE IN QUESTION later on. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI sincerely think that you should have exercised your right to unblock, seeing how u understood the issue, and the concerned admin or admins had no expanation for the block.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo reading, no understanding of the specific issue, no warning to the original guilty party, no warning to block, just block!!!! LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut Now, they will think hard before going on about their murky ways.NEWLINE_TOKENLOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, by extrapolating this, I have come to the conclusion that wiki is seriously and morally challenged and also lacks in competence. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll the more reason its needs me. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wont let you down wiki. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOf course, there must be many good decent admins like you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA few words about my messages I had sent.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWith regard to Vesther, we both know what I feel about him. HAHAHAHAHA. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENBut to be fair, its not his fault really. Its the incompetent power-mad admin's fault who probably hit buttons from a list before even reading the messages of both parties. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVesther just couldnt take it I guess after I repied back, giving him some of his own medicine, he just started crying. LOL. I guess he's not used to it. Maybe till now people just got bored of his obsessive ways and ignored him. LOL. Too bad. I see he has been receiving some much needed counselling from his best friend Crossmr who Did Not give him a warning for the very same words. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd he has further archived the discussions. Hmmmmm. Not a bad idea, when do u think I should archive that now-useless page, as it is I dont use it after I created an account. Anyway.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs to my own ways,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou dont know how much I was chuckling continuously after I inadvertently read some (parts of) messages while posting from proxies (to only legitimately protest and not to damage wiki's articles), after getting blocked, saying that it had all caused quite a bit of drama. I really did not want to crack the whip, but ...!!!! LOL. (even this terminology is borrowed). LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSomeone, u know who, was desperately trying to block me to prevent the truth about their actions from coming out. LOL. The petty cabal must have been trying to rustle up support. LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am still smiling and chuckling because of it all. Drama!

NEWLINE_TOKEN*Huh?, Hasn't Kasreyn vandalized the main ICP page?. NEWLINE_TOKEN* Why is this here?.

I disagee that this material is ``unreliable``I think it is notable, and not designed to bias the subject any more than it would be to say that Charles Nelson Reilly is gay. That said, I do believe that the structural bias in the article title is unacceptable, so this article should probably be deleted, but its content merged with the main article. I think it's a biased attempt by fans of ICP to keep this information out of the main article, and that the creator of this article was taking a valid stand by creating it if ICP fans are putting their own POV in the article.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Comment I'm not sure on what grounds you can propose to delete this article, or a remove it from the main ICP article. NEWLINE_TOKEN:*Comment It is that noteworthy and verified.  The text makes a reference to an interview in a magazine.  I have found the source of the material.  The article lists four references which are quite relevant information and are only there to make the article more substantial.  Personally, I am not a fan of the group or their style of music and do not care if the statements are true or false.  I am just trying to preserve the integrity of the article. If you can show me one valid reason for deletion, then I would consider supporting removing this from wiki.

I have not and would not add text to an existing article, so making it likely to be confused and/or open to squabbling.

66867275;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Jim Shapiro==NEWLINE_TOKENYour comments on deletion review were interesting, and I rather agree.  I wonder how one could find out if the article was created, deleted, then recreated.  I have only been editing Wikipedia a few months.  I had never heard of Jim Shapiro before I ran across this article.  I was appalled when I saw it, since it appeared to be such a hit piece.  It appears that this character deserved to have his license suspended, but it doesn't appear to be appropriate for Wikipedia.  My complaint has been that there have been entirely too much lawyer-bashing in Wikipedia, usually sourcing to ``Overlawyered``, a blatantly political site.  Speedy delete was surely appropriate as it appeared when deleted.  With the overhaul on the user's talk page, there are sources, but the article would still merit an AfD for non-notability.  Anyway, thanks for your comments. `;1269;1.0

Congrads Natey. You just blew the entire notion of Wikipedia:Assume good faith away. I've been argueing that the concept is unrealistic and outdated for months now. We should be simply willing to cut eachother some slack instead. Especially in cases such as this where someone one was responding to clear and repeated acts of incivility. Understandable if not inexcusable to the WP Politeness Police. But I disagree that Civility is an IRON LAW.

Creating a list and providing information all in one place about the workings of senior government jobs and how people move about in the Public Service is not disparaging. If they are so insecure that what they do is not legitimate then they should apply better practices and systems that are more legitimate. You wanting to hide information from the public about who the people are that run government in Ontario and their movement from one government organization to another like its some kind of secret only the mandarins can know is ver troubling. People thing of Canada as an honest country. You seem to think that it is not and the what our bureraucrats do should be hidden from public knowledge. You are pushinig POV and propaganda as well as censoring interesting and important information from Wiki because you obvioulsy feel it is disparging. Since you agree that what bureaucrats in Ontario and how they move about like bees from flower to flower collecting nectar from the public purse, you should be looking to help create a depository of information people can use to see how things work. Maybe we can clean up some of the bad things wwe hear about like the Adscam and GunScam and all of the other Scams plaguing Canada'c Civil Services at every level of goverment. Maybe its because they keep this kind of information so secret that they are able to get away with corrupt activities outside of public scrutiny. ;867;1.0

67461284;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Request for Clarification==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHello, Arthur Rubin (congratulations on your recent promotion to admin here at Wikipedia!). Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I'll be waiting until he/she/it gets back to renew my discussions with him/her/it. But as it happens, I just noticed that you responded to me in the CTMU AfD as follows:NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN``The only kind of theory capable of 'resolving an intractable paradox of physical science' is a theory formulated on a level above that of the paradox itself; thus, using the theory, one can define a function which resolves the paradox by mapping its (otherwise conflicting) elements consistently into observables. [That was me; now here's you:] WP:BOLLOCKS. Well, perhaps, not, but no such (intractable) paradox is discussed here. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) .`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm very sorry that I wasn't able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I'm afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I'd again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI ask, of course, because you are a ``relatively famous Wikipedian`` who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::For present purposes, we might as well define an ``intractable (scientific) paradox`` as an apparent inconsistency which is agreed to exist by experts in the relevant field(s) of science, but which those experts have failed to conclusively and consensually resolve despite their protracted efforts to do so. (Such an inconsistency can be any of several kinds.) The question of whether such paradoxes owe to a ``lack of imagination`` on the parts of the experts ``in almost all cases`` is thus really about the creative competence of those experts. But although it would be possible to justify some fairly negative judgments along those lines, that's still not the question I'm asking here. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The questions I'm asking here are (1) given such an inconsistency, can you resolve it without a metalanguage of the theory or theories (and data sets) which generate it, and (2) if you own that such a metalanguage is required, is this metalanguage - i.e., a language sufficient for the full expression of the interpretative mapping M:T<>U, where T stands for a (scientific) theory and U stands for the observable universe of that theory - necessarily scientific in nature? That is, in and of itself, does such a metalanguage necessarily involve observational applications of the scientific method (as opposed to the axiomatic method)?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::You go on to discuss the UV catastrophe. As we all know, the UV catastrophe was ``resolved`` by the quantization of light, ultimately leading to the development of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, there remains a problem with quantum mechanics: the formalism observably corresponds to reality only at limited junctures. The questions of if and how the rest of it corresponds to observable reality remain matters of widespread confusion, and have led to several conflicting interpretations of QM which are necessarily expressed in a ``philosophical`` metalanguage of QM (which can itself be cast as a metalanguage of classical mechanics). If one of these interpretations is ever refined to the extent that it can generate new falsifiable predictions, it will become ``scientific``. But until then, we're stuck with philosophical (observationally unfalsifiable) interpretations.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::You have already identified ``imagination`` as important in the resolution of scientifc paradoxes. This alone casts doubt on the notion that there exists any algorithm generating a valid resolution in every case. However, you still seem to believe that there is a set of principles which can be used to conclusively identify such resolutions once they are given, and more generally, to quickly and superficially distinguish between valid and invalid resolutions. Prior to encountering you, the Hillman agent, and certain others here at Wikipedia, I hadn't known of any such principles.

I am black and tried to argue that Louis Farrakhan would more neutrally write the ``Overview`` entry for the ``Leakey Foundation`` than the groups namesake Louis Leakey.

68757613;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Not to worry...jdorney will not be with Wikipedia much longer. ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have proved time and again that the corrections I make are 100% accurate and verifiable. I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a ``estimation`` at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British  Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly. I am not going to respond to any more whiney, and childish messages by jdorney. I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPS. Jdorney can leave more messages for me if he wants, but I will not respond to them, and all will be forwarded to Wikipedia staff for review.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI will also continue to monitor the IRA article and this article, to ensure that the correct facts are not continually changed, by a editor, who I doubt will be with Wikipedia much longer:)`;220;1.0

69129410;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Kurdistan?==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKurdistan is not a geo-political region. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iraq. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iran. There's no region called Kurdistan in Turkey. That's akin to placing an Algeristan in France, and making an article that treats it like a country. There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish ``state`` like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.  `;3178;1.0

69523605;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Answer to Osli73 ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThose with leftist agenda cannot be considered neutral observers due to their denial of genocide and open one-sidedness with Serbs and/or Milosevic, see Znet resource for example. When you mention ``Bosniak sources``, who are you referring to? Do you consider the International Tribunal a ``Bosniak source``? Srebrenica massacre is heavily based on Internationa Tribunal's rulling (e.g. Radislav Krstic judgement), and you are trying to destroy the article by inserting revisionist 'garbage' with the purpose of morally equivating victims with aggressors who committed genocide. The bottom line is: Alternative views do not matter, what matters is cold-harded facts from such sources as International Tribunal, Human Rights Watch, State-sponsored Research & Documentation Centre, International Missing Association (or whatever the official name is) etc. When it comes to editing this article in a ``rational matter``, you are the only one who rejects International Tribunal's version of the article and seeks Serbian (or pro-Serbian) version of the article. As you can see, you are not succeeding and your edits don't stay longer than couple of hours. People will not stand for your version of the article, because this is wikipedia and you cannot force people to accept your opinion and reject already established facts by International Crimes Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia and other neutral credible sources.  `;2382;1.0

72375981;`, 28 August 2006 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::It doesn't matter that the Pirate Party itself makes this claim.  Of course they make the claim.  What politician doesn't claim to be moderate?  What matters is that the claim is both baseless and biased.  An encyclopedia article is not the appropriate place for parroting campaign slogans as fact.  If you want to include the erroneous sentence, include it as a direct quotation from Pirate Party representatives.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Honestly, I don't think Swedes are capabling of identifying the center of the left-right scale.  You cite a quote that says they're willing to work with Democratic Socialists as well as ``liberal/conservative politics`` (note they did not say ``conservative politics``).  Why no mention of a conservative party?  The only party I see listed on Wikipedia that could be deemed conservative is the Christian Democrats, and I'm willing to bet they are extremely leftwing by American standards.  So perhaps a good way to rephrase the sentence in question would be:  ``Swedish political parties are so extremely leftwing that the Pirate Party, by comparison, is moderate.``  12:20`;2466;1.0

As you can see from me and Maynard and others on the site, we believe the most interesting thing about Niles IS his untrustworthiness.  His comic book accomplishments are minimal.

72525619;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:There is nothing to discuss because there is no logical reason given for the removal of this paragraph. If the article is ``too short`` in your opinion then you should lengthen it, not shorten it even more. Where is the precedent or rule at Wikipedia that says if an article is short you should remove any negative, documented history from the article? The logic is absurd. I can very well say the article is too short for a section on recent fundraising and just decide to remove that. What compromise are you looking for? I readded a link to the article and a very brief paragraph and apparently that is too much for you and that ideologue ``Derex``. You removed the item, YOU need to give a logical explaination for your actions. The article is too short doesn't cut it.  `;3051;1.0

I do, however; I co-founded Wikipedia. (I have since left the project.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia does have two big problems, and attention to them is long overdue. These problems could be eliminated by eliminating a single root problem. If the project's managers are not willing to solve it, I fear a fork (a new edition under new management, for the non-techies reading this) will probably be necessary.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet me preface this by saying that I know Wikipedia is very cool. A lot of people do not think so, but of course they are wrong. So the following must be taken in the spirit of someone who knows and supports the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst problem: lack of public perception of credibility, particularly in areas of detail. The problem I would like to point out is not that Wikipedia is unreliable. The alleged unreliability of Wikipedia is something that the above (TechCentralStation and AP) articles make much of, but that is not my point, and I am not interested in discussing that point per se.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy point is that, regardless of whether Wikipedia actually is more or less reliable than the average encyclopedia, it is not perceived as adequately reliable by many librarians, teachers, and academics. The reason for this is not far to seek: those librarians etc. note that anybody can contribute and that there are no traditional review processes. You might hasten to reply that it does work nonetheless, and I would agree with you to a large extent, but your assurances will not put this concern to rest.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou might maintain that people are already using Wikipedia a lot, and that that implies a great deal of trust. This is true, as far as it goes; but people use many sources that they themselves believe to be unreliable, via Google searches, for example. (I do so all the time, though perhaps I shouldn't.) Perhaps Wikipedia is better described as one of those sources regarded as unreliable which people read anyway. And in this case, one might say, there's no problem: Wikipedia is being read, and it is of minimally adequate and increasing reliability. What more could you ask? In other words, why does a perception of unreliability matter?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am willing to grant much of this reply. I think merely that there are a great many benefits that accrue from robust credibility to the public. One benefit, but only one, is support and participation by academia. I am on the academic job market now and I felt it was necessary to explain my views about Wikipedia's credibility for potential employers. A great many of my colleagues are not at all impressed with the project; but more about that in a bit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnother benefit accruing from robust public credibility is even more widespread use and support by teachers, schools, libraries, and the general publicprecisely the people who want to use what they believe to be a credible encyclopedia. To the extent that the project is not reaching, and being supported by, these people, it is not succeeding as well as it might.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPerhaps you might also maintain that, while Wikipedia does not now have a reputation for reliability, it will eventually, once enough studies proving its reliability are done, and once people are more familiar with the concept behind the project. This is hard to argue with; but it is also hard to support, because it involves predicting the future, and the future, when it comes to public opinion, is extremely unpredictable. It would be better to do something to help guarantee a reputation for reliability.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia has another sort of credibility problem, mentioned in passing above, and I fear that time is not a solution to this problem, the way it might be to the foregoing one. Namely, one can make a good case that, when it comes to relatively specialized topics (outside of the interests of most of the contributors), the project's credibility is very uneven. If the project was lucky enough to have a writer or two well-informed about some specialized subject, and if their work was not degraded in quality by the majority of people, whose knowledge of the subject is based on paragraphs in books and mere mentions in college classes, then there might be a good, credible article on that specialized subject. Otherwise, there will be no article at all, a very amateurish-sounding article, or an article that looks like it might once have been pretty good, but which has been hacked to bits by hoi polloi. (Am I sounding elitist enough for you yet? Just wait.) One has only to compare the excellent Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy or The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy to Wikipedia's Philosophy section. From the point of view of a specialist, let's just say that Wikipedia needs a lot of work.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond problem: the dominance of difficult people, trolls, and their enablers. I stopped participating in Wikipedia when funding for my position ran out. That does not mean that I am merely mercenary; I might have continued to participate, were it not for a certain poisonous social or political atmosphere in the project.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are many ways to explain this problem, and I will start with just one. Far too much credence and respect accorded to people who in other Internet contexts would be labelled ``trolls.`` There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups and mailing lists that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you attempt to take trolls to task or demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry ``censorship,`` attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. This drama has played out thousands of times over the years on unmoderated Internet groups, and since about the fall of 2001 on the unmoderated Wikipedia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENConsequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to ``work with`` persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation.NEWLINE_TOKENN";1390;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Apparently she wants no one to know that Ryulong deleted my request for help on Khoikhoi's talk page, falsely describing my request for help as ``vandalism`` in his edit summary. Oops! Was it ``uncivil`` again, for me to tell the truth? If so, then prosecutors in court will never be able to tell the truth about crimes, because it would be an ``uncivil`` ``personal attack`` to use words such as ``lie``, ``dishonest``, ``vandal``, ``thief``, ``murderer``, ``rapist``, etc. The judge would get too upset by such ``uncivil comments``. Come to think of it, every time an admin describes a user's action as ``vandalism``, or a user as a ``vandal``, that's an improper ``personal attack``, according to pschemp's logic. If pschemp treats people equally (not likely), then she better block all the admins who make those ``personal attacks`` of describing a particular user's behavior as ``vandalism``.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCompass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWorship Rights NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Even if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,” the pastor told Compass. “By the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there. But they say, ‘Okay, go try to practice your rights, but we will stop you.’” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn light of Lebanon’s deeply entrenched ethnic and religious divides, it is not uncommon for government officials to carry deeper loyalties for their particular community leaders than for the central government and civil law. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“In this type of community, the bishop would always be consulted in a matter [of building a new church],” one local source close to the Maronite church told Compass. Requesting anonymity for security reasons, he said, “All it would take is one word from the bishop for the place to be opened. But they’ve never had a Protestant Reformation in the Middle East, so they don’t know quite what to do with these new evangelical groups.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe source added, “It’s not to say that the bishop is right, but one has to understand that Lebanon has a very tribal society.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Our problem is not with the Maronite church, it’s with this bishop,” Abou-Mekhael told Compass. “Our church, founded in 1995, had been meeting in a rented facility in the town of Ballouneh before this, and we had no problems there. All of my Maronite neighbors and friends are saddened by what is happening.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBishop Noujaim said the conflict is not just religious but political. “Why do the Baptists want to settle in a patriarchal diocese?” he said. “Do they want to weaken the Maronite patriarchate by stealing some believers and further dividing the Christian community, which has already suffered in this way?” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDropping birth rates and emigration have caused a decrease in Lebanon’s Maronite population in recent years. For many, this translates into a weakening of political power. According to estimates, approximately 20 percent of the Lebanese population (half of Lebanon’s Christians) belong to the Maronite Church. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUpon gaining independence in 1943, Lebanon’s Christian community, mainly Maronite, constituted more than 50 percent of the country’s population, playing a significant role in bolstering Maronite representation in the central government vis-à-vis other religious and ethnic groups. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Christians in the Middle East are so few that we need each other,” Abou-Mekhael commented. “We need to support each other. It’s really too bad what has happened, because we were preparing the building to help host refugees from the south.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah troops in southern Lebanon ended in an official ceasefire on August 14, allowing hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Lebanese to begin returning home. Triggered by the Hezbollah kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers on July 12, the fighting claimed more than 1,000 Lebanese and 150 Israeli lives. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSIDEBAR NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMounting Tensions Erupt in Strife in Mountain Village NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTension over the newly-built Christ Bible Baptist Church had been mounting since April 2006, when the congregation legally purchased the building from Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and requested that the Ajaltoun government construct signs along the path to the church. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbou-Mekhael told Compass he had purchased the land in 2004 and had built the building in the interest of using it for the church. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe mayor’s office informed the Baptist congregation that it would need to consult Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim before granting permission to place the signs. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn July 17, Mayor Khalil Tabet met Abou-Mekhael and three Baptist members, telling them to close down the building because Bishop Noujaim did not want another evangelical church in the area. According to Abou-Mekhael, Tabet threatened to bring a mob to forcibly shut down the church the next Sunday. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUndeterred, the Baptist congregation began giving out invitations for the church’s official commencement on Sunday, July 23. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn response, Maronite villagers distributed fliers calling on the townspeople to gather the following Sunday (July 23) at 4 p.m. to march together to the Baptist church and “deny its commencement.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWritten in Bishop Noujaim’s name and also broadcast on local television, the flier claimed that the church had been built “deceptively and in crooked ways,” and that it was “the right of the church and civil authorities to deny it in all ways.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVisiting the village to celebrate mass on Saturday evening (July 22), Bishop Noujaim reiterated his call for the townspeople to stop the church commencement, village priest Paul Sfeir said in the Addiyar newspaper. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“I went to Ajaltoun church to inform people that the Baptists are not a Catholic church,” the bishop told Compass, sidestepping questions about whether it was true that he had asked the townspeople to march on the Baptist church. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBishop Noujaim also failed to say why he had not called police to stop the meeting if it was indeed being held illegally as he claimed. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEarlier that day (July 22), Tabet had hired a bulldozer to block the Baptist church road and the building’s front g";1356;1.0

America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become ``a very powerful and scary radicalized community``.

74274045;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== POV  talk section moved ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==POV==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENi've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for ``edit warring`` by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the ``see also`` section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is ``part of the series on christianity``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENthis article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy ``criticism`` section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are ``taught to speak in hebrew`` (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to ``target vulnerable jews`` (oh really?) and ``most of the funding comes from christians`` (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader ``is not jewish`` (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENsome of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the ``buddhism`` article to say that ``all buddhists will burn in hell`` along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENanyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that ``NPOV`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Thanks for the ``friend``, nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of ``pushing my delusions``.   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that ``all`` ``mainstream`` jewish groups, including ``secular`` groups ``strongly`` oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who ``all`` the ``mainstream`` jewish groups are, and what degree of ``opposition`` is ``strong``.  Can you really not see this simple truth?NEWLINE_TOKEN::Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs ``vulnerable jews`` are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were ``vulnerable`` to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches ``vulnerable jews``.NEWLINE_TOKEN::It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers ``strongly oppose`` DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be ``strongly opposed`` to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.NEWLINE_TOKEN::Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article ``christianity`` is there a section labeled ``incompatibility with paganism`` and ``a belief that is incompatible with paganism`` and ``all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity``?   Do we see ``incompatibility with catholicism`` in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete.NEWLINE_TOKEN::What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called ``Jews for Jesus`` and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would ``Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish`` be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.   They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus ``deceiving`` ipod owners into believing in jesus.NEWLINE_TOKEN::I've given up on the fair play of;1190;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKEN:Never mind...Wetman removed it.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo let me see if I get this straight. I follow the npov guideline on what another groups belief structure is on a particul subject and it gets removed. Yes the idea may insult some but there are those that share these particular beliefs. If google books has no problem publishing the full text of this groups belief structure on this particular subject matter than why should Wikipedia. The fact is there are people that believe this to be true. When Wetman deletes this fact stating ``removed vanity-published anonymously-authored simplistic rant: ``knowledge=books``.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNOTAB_TOKENILITYNEWLINE_TOKENNonetheless there is no dictum against any book that is reasonably spread or otherwise well-known or remarkable. Ask yourself if several libraries or bookshops, or a no-subscription website have a copy of the book, so that other wikipedians can easily consult the book, or at least have access to on-line or press-published reviews of the book.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUsually, books with an ISBN-number and/or availability in a couple dozen of libraries and/or a Project Gutenberg type website, and with a notability above that of an average cookbook or programmers manual would qualify.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe book I referred to has LCCN 2003097908 and a ISBN-number 1-4107-9815-1 although the paperback version of the book has been sold out for sometime and only available in secondary markets, the electronic version is available free through google books. The point of the post was not to promote the entire book but only refer to that portion of the book that refers to the subject at hand. The belief structure of a particular group on what the ``tree of knowledge of good and evil`` is. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Well, there was a dispute over the Church of Reality's views some time back... see Talk:Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil/off-topic. Other than that, I suggest you .    `;938;1.0

What I tend to do when coming across situations like this is to assume the comment (on that AfD) was made in all seriousness, and deal with it as if its the first time such a comment were made, rather than it just being the first time I saw it. Anyways, it is easy to be civil and assume good faith when you are uninvolved. Hopefully the situation is finished unfolding between you two. · NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I think that's a great way to approach it. In any case, it seems to have been resolved, although I wonder whether that's just because I've stopped responding (I suggested s/he ask someone else - of their choice - to mediate our dispute and s/he has apparently chosen not to do so). Maybe that's sometimes the best course of action... In any case, thank you for your measured response at the AfD. All the best,  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== TbIndustries.png ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOK, I can see that the image could be classed as ``non-encyclopedic content``. It's my own logo, which I created myself, however according to the policies you pointed out, it doesn't have a place on Wikipedia. The image was intended as a userpic, as I don't like putting my face on the interneet, but I'll remove it and tag the image for deletion anyway.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If you created it, then the problem can probably be alleviated by releasing it under the GFDL or similar license. The issue is that the image was marked as being copyrighted and claimed as fair use. In this case, Wikipedia strictly confines this usage to articles. I had a MLB baseball team logo removed from my userpage, which is why I'm now familiar with this policy. Anyways, you can probably just change the license, provided you are comfortable with releasing the image. T· NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I'm not sure if I want to release it or under what license.

This template was created to replace all other Monty Python user templates in an attempt to show that GUS is not the only option available to gain control of user templates. I am violently and vehemently against GUS and the userfication of ANY template no matter how small. Please read my oppositional statement on the GUS. There would be no need for any templates to be moved into user space if there were fewer of them, and right now I am attempting to make that happen.  The other redundant Monty Python templates should have been deleted, however, some users were so vocal that they were kept. Those templates you can do what you will with them.

The articles provide all the info the reader requires in a well-laid out format. Look at this one: Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for example; I could care less about what the article says (as with PETA, to be sure) - but I care deeply that it says it all and it says it right. The crtisicsm/controversy sections do not seem to be attracting undue attention in those articles. I suggest the reason for their excellence is that these articles are written correctly, being unbiased, balanced and written by authors who have no agenda.

75944591;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Don't you understand that what is commonly called ``Nazi Punk`` doesn't have to mean one being politically a National Socialist? If you bother to read the first paragraph in the article, Punk bands and individuals who are ``believers in extreme Nationalism, Fascism, Racialism, or National Socialism`` are considered ``Nazi Punks``. A.B.H. were White Power (racialists) and extremely Nationalistic at one point in their career and therefore, by Wikipedia (and common scene) definition, a Nazi Punk band. They fall under two of the qualifications. I know that a lot of people like A.B.H. and have an interest in others not thinking they were White Nationalists, but the fact remains they were at one point, despite the fact they later changed their views. Perhaps putting a side-note saying that the band later changed their views should be added, but that's it. This article is a historical look at the Nazi Punk (i.e. Racist Punk) subculture and white washing certain band's histories isn't right and should not be tolerated.

76354411;`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::First, trying to pull ``rank`` with me, is not an effective way to be persusive with me or to appear as an ally or friendly. Second, you have misread my statement and missed my major point about vagina and penis. The point is that the article itself explans that a vaginoplasty is surgery to create a vagina. It is therefore obvious that any photographs of surgery in and around a penis or vagina will contain such things in the photograph. I believe that is is entirely appropriate to set the example that photographs of genitalia in medical and educational contexts are appropriate for all audiences. I believe that the precedent should be set that the penis and the vagina or more accurately in most cases the vulva should not be given special attention in medical contexts. To do so, gives the misimpression that there is something ``wrong`` with human genitalia, which is a falsehood, and an antedeluvian cultural bias whose primitive nature should be abolished. In this century and millenium, is it time for such puritanical prudishness to end. One of the best ironies of discussions about such ``warnings`` around medical photos is that they primarily serve to heighten the existence and nature of the photographs, and probably invite more study of them than might otherwise occur. In other words, they have the opposite of their intended purpose. The tend to draw more attention to such material, than might otherwise occur, while the tacit intention of people who want to put similarly silly warnings about such material is to ``hide`` them and be bashful around them. It is high time that humans grow up and get over this silly aversions to the site of human genitalia. The wikipedia should be a place that sets an appropriate standard that medical information should be free from the psuedo censorship that such ``warnings`` represent. On another note, on the basis of WP:V, a large portion of the wikipedia would be candidate for deletion. I believe such mention constitutes evidence that this article is being given unfair over-attention by a tacit faction whose true purpose is to censor subjects like the sort to which Toby Meltzer and its ``Good Article`` subject matter relates. First and foremost, such good articles serve to refute the rampant misinformation in the minds of the average populace.  21:17, 17 September 2006.`;1190;1.0

I will end this day knowing and believing I contributed well to the ``actual`` content of wikipedia, in spite of the unwarranted, rude, abusive, actions of a few wikipedians, and an even fewer wikipedia admins.

Since it's a part of an ongoing research piece by a working journalist, I've decided that any distorition to the research could be problematic. Thus, the simplest thing to do in order to avoid antagonizations, distortions, etc, is to remove it. Since you have decided to continue this antagonization, I am left with no alternative but to report you to those in a place of authority at Wikipedia. Of course, you may feel free to complete and post your own research on the Havana shipyards however, I've decided the best course of action is to register the copyright on all pertinent research statements and images associated with this article.

76420380;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInternet television and movie databases are contemporary things and primarily for television and movie actors and voice actors fortunate enough to get credit for their work in visual media.  I am only now returning to voice work after 20 years in the legal profession.  I did a number of TV spots for local broadcast  in the 80's, prior to the availability of Internet databases and any real recognition of voice over talent.  We were primarily behind the scenes back then and my work was not reviewed.  I was simply hired or not hired.  And while these exchanges for inclusion in Wikipedia have been a little humbling, they remind me both that voice actors have always struggled for recognition   and that it really isn't something I'm that concerned about in the great scheme of things.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI do appreciate that Wikipedia maintains guidelines to assure that articles provide some value to the Wiki community, but I honestly believe that information should be available and readers should be afforded the opportunity to decide for themselves whether there is value in the material. It may glut the database, but part of the charm of Wikipedia is the ability to find some information on just about anything.  Value, like notability, is a subjective thing, and I would urge that such criteria not carry more weight than it should be afforded in your determination.  Nevertheless, remove this article if it doesn't meet your guidelines.  It won't necessarily bruise my ego or deter me from my work, whether or not it's recognized.  That isn't really an essential part of what I do in providing disembodied voices.  I would still rather be heard than seen or known.;2115;1.0

AA419 is not the law and it is not a web host.  Therefore, its actions are a form of vigilante action, despite their belief it is for the greater good.  I'm not defending 419 perpetrators and I believe they should be shut down.  However, taking the law into your own hands is not something that should be suggested when there are legal channels otherwise.`;3786;1.0

I guess that my posting was more of a heads up than anything else, like maybe this is something to be watching for in case it happens to other contributors.

76980276;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I blieve the translation from the press office is very good. For someone who is not German this may not be clear, but the first paragraph states intentions, not facts. In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing. If you want to do a literal translation, the upper version is closer to the original, while the press office version is closer to the meaning.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Diverse errors and unencelopedic context use ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would like to ask this whole article to be checked through. While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process isNEWLINE_TOKEN*The outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.NEWLINE_TOKENWhile the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:NEWLINE_TOKEN*Any war could and should be categorised as an ``atrocity`` but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....NEWLINE_TOKENUnverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.NEWLINE_TOKEN*...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.NEWLINE_TOKENWhile it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.NEWLINE_TOKENDirectly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

78177640;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirstly, some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts?  Also, the reason I decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what I had said.  Perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what I said but they did not apply to what I said and meant.  Perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what I mean and try not to take offense so easily.  I am respecting the basic rules of Wikipedia, but I also exploited ``loop holes`` in the rules.  So if you want to include what I did in the rules then do so, but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning.  And I'm so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page.  You asked that we do something, i.e. explain the significance of the clan, etc, and we did but you deleted it anyway.  And then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us.  Also, one of the pages I read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth...well what kind of bullshit is that?  If this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth?  Also, if I go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then I can site that and it becomes verifiable right?  If you say no, then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit.  Before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight. `;1305;1.0

78440946;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Fair use images and original article ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't understand this neurotic compulsion that people seem to have to scrap all of my contributions to this article.  The third paragraph that was previously removed, and which I have now reinstated, contains relevant description for this article.  Similar descriptions appear in other porn-related articles on wikipedia.  As for the pictures, the lead image is a promotional photo head shot and it is a much better representation of the subject than an amateur fan pic.  The ``Helles Belles`` image illustrates relevant text in the article.  In fact, fair use rationales and appropriate licensing tags have been provided for both of these images.  I don't understand what the problem is since both images are regularly used for promotional purposes by the copyright holder to market Laura Angel and products related to her.  Thus, the appearance of these same images on wikipedia is altogether fair and appropriate as an accurate visual representation of the subject.  Also, both of the images I have added to this article are much more characteristic of Laura's professional appearance than the Brussels fan pic.  If someone wants to expand the article and add the fan pic somewhere alongside further text down below they are free to do so.  However, I request that people refrain from taking out perfectly legitimate and accurate contributions that have already been made to this article.`;3601;1.0

It's not their responsibility. 2) I don't know of any police organization that would take the time to investigate a death threat from an anonymous IP on the internet.  3) When the police are called about death threats, they'll often tell you to wait until the person making the death threat shows up and then call them again.  You apparently need psychiatric help.  I know a seriously unbalanced personality when I see one.  By restoring that information about the nipple slip, you have ruined a perfectly good encyclopedic article and turned it into a trashy supermarket tabloid.  Congratulations.  You're one of the worst editors here, and you're probably headed for a permanent block.  Don't post comments on my talk page again.  If you do, they will be deleted.  You have no positive things to say, no positive contributions to make.  You need to clean up your act, or leave Wikipedia.  Nobody needs or wants editors like you.  By the way, archive your talk.

I guess I will give the first response to you. Obviously, this should not be seen as a fight between ``you or anyone else and all Jews everywhere.`` I will, however, disagree with some of what you say, which I think you will agree is legitimate. Our goal should not be to score points against each other's beliefs, but to come to some common consensus about what is NPOV and report on it accordingly. By the way, you are also right in assuming that I am socially and culturally JewishI'm not too keen on any definition of ethnicity that fits my particular circumstances (long story ...). I am also professionally Jewish, working at a Jewish museum developing curricula and actually dealing with a lot of these issues in a professional capacity. While I am the first to admit that my education, focusing on Judaic studies, may prejudice some of what I write, so will the facts that I am also a staunch agnostic (I think God is too irrelevant to address the issue of its existence), a socialist, and the holder of three passports (American, Canadian, and Israeli). Before you jump to any conclusions, I also define myself as a disillusioned Zionist and currently a ``cultural autonomist`` (I believe in the preservation of a Jewish cultural identity in the Diaspora). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy am I saying all of this? To give you some idea of the complexity of defining one's self as Jewish.

I guess I will give the first response to you. Obviously, this should not be seen as a fight between ``you or anyone else and all Jews everywhere.`` I will, however, disagree with some of what you say, which I think you will agree is legitimate. Our goal should not be to score points against each other's beliefs, but to come to some common consensus about what is NPOV and report on it accordingly. By the way, you are also right in assuming that I am socially and culturally JewishI'm not too keen on any definition of ethnicity that fits my particular circumstances (long story ...). I am also professionally Jewish, working at a Jewish museum developing curricula and actually dealing with a lot of these issues in a professional capacity. While I am the first to admit that my education, focusing on Judaic studies, may prejudice some of what I write, so will the facts that I am also a staunch agnostic (I think God is too irrelevant to address the issue of its existence), a socialist, and the holder of three passports (American, Canadian, and Israeli). Before you jump to any conclusions, I also define myself as a disillusioned Zionist and currently a ``cultural autonomist`` (I believe in the preservation of a Jewish cultural identity in the Diaspora). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy am I saying all of this? To give you some idea of the complexity of defining one's self as Jewish.

NEWLINE_TOKEN#Oppose. While I have nothing particular against this user, I am not totally convinced of Khoikhoi's neutrality on several subjects.

It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying.

81311944;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:First, I'd like to thank you for discussing this issue with me.  You could just have told me to take a hike or something.  Anyway, let's take a look at Image:Esquire Jennifer Connelly 1991 8.jpg, the Jennifer Connelly picture that I tagged today.  The image was moved to the infobox this morning which means that it was not being used according to the license.  It was instead being used specifically to depict Connelly, not in context of discussing that particular issue of the magazine.  That's why I tagged that image.  With the image moved back to the paragraph concerning the issue of the magazine, a compelling argument could be made that the image is now being used in accord with the license.  This seems to be the consensus of the people on the discussion page as well, though the discussion just started.  So, whether or not this image is fair-use depends on how it is used in the article.  I am much happier if this is spelled out in a rationale on the image page.  That the license specifically states that a detailed fair-use rationale should be added seems, to me, to support this contention.  In this case, the rationale would be simple, something along the lines of, ``used to depict issue of magazine in question in paragraph which discusses this issue, not solely to depict Connelly.``  Now, I previously mentioned that the image description page specifically mentions that the dvdcover requires a detailed rationale.  In many cases, the fair-use case is obvious.  It's a DVD cover used to illustrate the particular DVD in question.  But the image description page and the license text both still indicate that the rationale is required.  Also, what often ends up happening is that the DVD image then gets used to depict something outside of the license.  A DVD of a movie starring Connelly, for example, used solely to illustrate what Connelly looks like.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Now, I've been using the fair-use-disputed tag for quite some time but recently, people have been correcting that to the missing-rationale tag, so I just started using that.  This has the added advantage of requiring that the issue be resolved in short order and providing a simple copy-and-paste official warning template which can be used (and is specifically designed) to warn the person who uploaded the image.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I am concerned that a great number of images on Wikipedia are used in blatant violation of copyright.  This is clear and I doubt anyone would debate it.  As a result, I personally do request that people who upload copyrighted images provide an accurate source, an accurate license, and a detailed fair-use rationale.  In all honesty, I'm quite happy with any reasonable attempt at a fair-use rationale and accept many that I believe fall far short of what Wikipedia officially requests.  I believe it is important to deal with images without sufficient information because continuing to accept images which may violate copyright put us at direct risk.  It may be obvious to the uploader why an image is fair-use but we may not be able to contact the uploader when we are sued.  And as I mentioned before, I believe both the license and image description help page specifically require this.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Now that I have stated my point and you have stated your point, there's a very good chance that we aren't going to agree.  I'm happy to request additional help, perhaps from the admin noticeboard policies page, if you think this would be productive.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Jennifer_Connelly ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is a discussion of the fair use assertment of an image going on for this page.  Your comments on the talk page would be much appreciated. note:This message has been sent to all recent registered editors of the article, less vandal fighters —   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Reversions ==NEWLINE_TOKENHey, every place I've contributed, everything reverted. I spent a lot of time making contributions and you went and reverted everything. A whole bunch of stuff. It looks like you may have just pressed an undo button of everything I did because there's no basis of reverting it. This stuff I'm looking at is not vandalism at all. Without getting all the information to figure out if I was a sockpuppet, you not only blocked me but reverted all of my edits to? I can't even go back and change it because I would be changing a lot of work other writers have done here at wikipedia too. And it would be like doing what you did to me, to others. No offense or anything, but a good administrator looks into a situation without taking sides. I've basically wasted a lot of time here because of all the reversions on top of being accused of being a sockpuppet. Still and all, nothing was done to the people who erroneously accused me of being a sockpuppet. I really wish there was a bit more justice here at wikipedia!  `;473;1.0

81475888;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Letter to User:Zoe==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe world of Wikipedia is not what it should be and would be if people would not INITIATE personal attacks while correcting possible or actual violations of The Five Pillars of Wikipedia. The first round of Word Wars against me began all because I dared write about myself an article. Sure, call it self-promotion, but self-aggrandizement it is not. I was not fully aware of the rules then, but the fact is that there are people, not unlike myself, who are worthy of mention on Wikipedia, have sufficient write-ups, press coverage throughout the years or were a significant phenomena at a time, but who: a) cannot afford to hire PR and Publicity firms to have someone write about them on Wikipedia or b) would not impose upon their prominent friends to do so! Wikipedia should have a Special Cases Department, just as government should, were certain exceptional individuals can have their day in ``Wiki Court``, and have a determination made by a ``Wiki Jury`` as to whether or not they deserve a mention in Wikipedia. In any case, Alec Wilkinson, of New Yorker magazine fame, intends on writing an article about me for Wikipedia, partly out of fairness, since there is mention of Amy Alkon and her two partners in plagiarism. Amy Alkon, Advice Goddess, was one of the Three Free Advice Ladies. They read my write-up in The New Yorker and attempted to become famous at my expense! Until that time my life as The Free Advice Man was quite fulfilling, and I managed to help many people, including some on the verge of suicide. You may want to visit www.infinitysociety.org/FREEADVICEMAN.html to get the full story. Why does this matter?? Because, while it is true that I may have violated Wiki Rules in the past, which I no longer seek to do (as of Tom Harrison's warning), Wikipedia could benefit from an eccentric contributor. Yes I was and I am very angry to find that there are Wikipedians who will make unscientific statements about another person's intellectual accomplishments and worth.  Yes it is likely that there are people who go too far in enforcing the NO ORIGINAL CONTENT pillar. I am astounded that no one ever cared then (neither User:Trovatore, User:MikeTwo, or any of the current Wikipedians involved in this case) or now to make a sincere effort to contact Prof. Miklos Hernadi at The Hungarian Academy of Sciences, who will verify my status as a philosopher and who is aware of media reports in Hungary about my life as a philosopher from 1994 to 2002, including a published book of mine for which he wrote a Peer Review (he has a Ph.D.). And should Alec Wilkinson submit an article about me there should be no reason for it to be deleted. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLook, I am 42 years of age and more European than American. Maybe Wikipedia is age-blind, but people who are younger, and perhaps less accomplished in life, should take the other person's age into consideration and communicate in a respectful and polite manner. If you analyze the whole matter, and if you are seriously interested in objectivity and making the world a better place, then you may yet come to the understanding that I never initiated any attacks, even though I did overreact at times. Also, about anti-Semitism... When someone attacks me, who really does not know me, my life's story and the reasons why the media has covered me, and dares claim that I am practically a ``nobody`` then my reactions are perfectly understandable and given that the strong appearance of malice exists, why should I, as a Jew, not conclude, especially about persons who openly admit strong Christian identities with Christian groups that have a known track record for being anti-Jewish. Maybe CRCulver is not aware of his hate for the concept of infinity, which is my specialty and to which I profess my intellectual support for. Maybe he is not an anti-Semite, but he sure did not communicate to me (right from the beginning) as one would normally expect. As for promoting certain views and ideas; most Wikipedians and people working on Wikipedia do this all the time! Some more subtly than others. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway, you've blocked me indefinitely... Who benefits?? Look: I never went around looking to insult Wikipedians over their violations or mistakes; I never deleted information (because I think that there should be people in Wikipedia assigned for that sort of thing, and those should not be the same as those who add information!!!); .....in fact, come to think of it, that is a great idea! People who do the verifying of facts should not be those who write them...separation of Wikipowers!.... Anyway, adding an article titled ``Infinitology`` is not violating the ``NO ORIGINAL CONTENT`` pillar, because nowhere in that article did I talk about my name or my identity (other than being the author), and in fact talked about such prominent individuals, living and deceased, as Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Giordano Bruno, Baruch Spinoza, etc.... Anyway, since there are hundreds of known cases of people who have been blocked from Wikipedia who are actually accredited Ph.D.'s, librarians, intellectuals, etc. and since there are dozens of persons who are convinced beyond a doubt that Wikipedia is run amock by sinister cabals and that there is an anti-Semitic slant prevalent in many of its articles, as well as cleverly placed and subtle Neo-Con distortions of facts to benefit the Neo-Con attempt to control information and knowledge content and access...since all that is REAL...I am not too troubled by my own predicament and know that I am, relatively speaking, more of a victim of attacks than a perpetrator of violations of Wiki standards... Some day I will be riding a major wave of recognition and publicity, even if only, as was with Spinoza, after my demise...although I hope that I will live to reap the intellectual rewards in my natural life... So, before you pass final judgment on me do me the kindness, as the attorney for Yakov Bok did in ``The Fixer`` by Bernard Malamud (a most impressive literary work...made into a great movie starring Alan Bates), and read up on me at my web-site (and inside the digital New Yorker, and dozens of other publications). Then, and only then, will you be able to understand my POV and why I was right to feel attacked! Whoever you are...foe or friend or neutral...I wish you will make Wikipedia a much better place for its contributors...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHope to hear from you some day ( to contact me go to www.infinitysociety.org and use the auto-form).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBest,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJP `";476;1.0

81987508;`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::It's hard to say that moving it to the WP space would find a concensus.  There are certain topics where it's obvious a notability criterion is needed (essentially, to keep out spam/vanity).  But even those have some flexible points to allow for the argument I'm trying to make.  That Science is a rediculously vague topic, and because the number of Geneticists is much larger than the number of Cosmologists, the number of citations for a Cosmology paper to be ``as notable`` (whatever the fuck that means) as a Genetics paper is lower than the number of citations the Genetics paper has.  While the textbook criterion tries to replace that, it does so in a way that hacks at one of Wikipedia's greatest strengths: Being current.  `;155;1.0

82573758;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Help on suspect vandalism ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi, Dave )NEWLINE_TOKENI found your page thru the Mediation Cabal page. I'm a little discouraged and confused and I'd like to ask for your help. See, I came across this article that somebody added a redirect.  without moving the page, and then this user  blanked the article and changed the redirect to Haji Mohammad Suharto. I think the latter is some sort of vandalism (I'm not sure) since Haji Mohammad Suharto has suppressed Chinese culture during his rule and this may be a disrespect towards Chinese Indonesian. Anyway, I moved the talk page and asked for a WP:SPLICE request. And when I was going to leave a talk on  talk page, I was discouraged by the user's talk page. Seems there's been conflicts with this user for almost the entire talk page. So, I went looking for help and I found you. What do you think? Is this somekind of vandalism? What steps should be taken on this issue? Sorry to bother you for this, but thanks in advance. Feureau ;2742;1.0

83138645;"`== NetObjects, Inc. ==NEWLINE_TOKENCan you visit the NetObjects, Inc. article again? It was tagged as advertising. I made some changes to meet the complaints. What is your opinion?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Who is able to place an advert-tag?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Considerating your advice I did some further editing. However I wanted to keep the numbers because that's what people want to know about a company. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Thank you for your help. So, I can go on writing more articles ;)  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: Yes, I make it in a row ;) NetObjects Fusion will be the next article due in autumn 2006. I already have some pieces and images also. Probably after that I will go on with a smaller article covering Rae Technology as the ``missing link`` between Apple and NetObjects.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: Done.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreat! Thank you for your time and your work. I know I uploaded before proof-reading, but I wanted to take the space of that article before someone else, because I already invested a lot of time. Additional proof-readings by 2 people for factual errors and better English will take place though - although English probably cannot be improved after your corrections ;). Last week a friend who teaches English literature at the University came with quite some corrections on the NetObjects, Inc. article - mainly prepositions.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs you might have noticed my mother-tongue is German and I use it in a more secure way than English. For instance the chapter ``Texte`` in this article is completely written by me. However, IMO overall quality of English Wikipedia is better and it is more of a challenge to me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe next article/s? I guess I have to change the red links into blue ones ;). In other words: fill gaps. The very next article will be ``Rae Technologies``, the (in Wikipedia) missing link between Apple and NetObjects. I will run into problems there, because most of the sources on ``Rae`` lie buried down in print archives. Accessible material will do for a short article, which will easily get tagged with a stub-banner. On the other hand original research - which I could do in this case - is not allowed which I see as one of the problems of Wikipedia.  `";1358;1.0

83915578;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Brantley Thompson ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI read about how Brantley Thompson makes out with a guy name Bobby. But as I read on it says that he fell head over heels for girl name Nicole. It also says that he ``loved`` a girl name Lindsey for two years. How is this? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWell I'll tell you. Ok see what we have here people is people who are trying to be funny. Haddy and Harry. Haddy is middle easten by the way so feel free to be piss off with him. Harry is someone who thinks he is the real God. In other words he belives he is God. He can do anything that the Bible says. So he is just what he is. A person that is 17 years old in the 10th grade that does weed and gets drunk. This goes to show that none of this is true. Harry is mad that Thompson thought his little group was gay and left it. From what I have heard Harry got drunk and someone told him some stuff that wasn't true. So he belives that Thompson has said some stuff about him. Which in a matter of fact is wrong. Haddy is in on this because of maybe two reasons. One is that Harry made him do it. The other reason is that because Haddy doesn't like Thompson ,because Thompson and Bobby makes fun of him. This is the only reason why this Brantley Thompson topic was on this article. It was only made to make fun of him. Well it really has died down very fast and didn't get around that much. So to the people of Wikipedia I am sorry for this wrong, misleading, and messed up article topic. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe real truth about Brantley Thompson is this. Yes he does play Airsoft but not anymore. Bobby is just a friend of Thompson. Brantley Thompson is not Bi nor Gay. Brantley Thompson did like a girl name Lindsey Brown for two years but stop because he got the hint that they'll be just friends. Brantley Thompson does like a girl name Nicole, but she is not 13. Nicole is 16 and as of now has no boyfriend. Brantley Thompson is one of her best friends. Brantley Thompson does not play Sonic The Hedgehog nor does he love Final Fantasy, but just likes the games. Brantley Thompson hasn't play any type of game for two years. Brantley Thompson does not belive that if you stare at the Earth long enough you can see the ground moving. That was joke from one of his friends and thought he would go around and say it. Brantley Thompson is not crazy about the U.S. Marine Corps. He just wants to join because of his family has done it. That is the real truth about Brantley Thompson.`;2954;1.0

Turing degrees`` without defining what ``r.e.`` stands for  you do define it later in the article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome background/history might be useful (here or in another article with a recursion context):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe word recursion: First use (1616), comes from recur, to run again, L. re- + currere, (as in current). To repeat. Recursion: ``RETURN``. ``the determination of a succession of operations on one or more preceeding elements according to a rule or formula involving a finite number of steps`` (or not  recursive: ``...a procedure that can repeat itself indefinitely, or until a specified condition is met.``)  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPeano's definitions that followed the Peano axioms are recursive in nature and these came from Dedekind, correct? What possessed Dedekind and Peano to investigate this? Then what happened in the time between Peano-Dedekind, and ``primitive recursive functions`` (who first defined those?) and ``recursive functions`` of Gödel-Turing-Post-Herbrand-Church-Péter-Ackermann-Kleene etc? Wasn't it the antinomies/paradoxes of Russell ca 1900 and his crowd? and Cantor's method on top of it  a kink in the Logicist/Finitist program of Hilbert? So was it Hilbert's problems that focused their work on ``Foundations`` and ``Metamathematics``? Did Brouwer and his band of merry men play a role? This brings us up to ca 1950. We have Kleene's book (1952) (+ his professorship) which seems to me to be the magnus opus that set off Wang, Davis, Minsky, Melzak, Lambek, and ?? and all the host that was to split off to became the ``theoretical computer scientists`` (and some Russians too, isolated by the cold war). That left the die-hard recursion theorists. I loose the ``recursion theorist`` thread from 1960 on. Hilbert's tenth is solved. Gödel was on his last legs, Chaitin was a student. From 1960 point on  who were the players? Who, or what ``schools of thought``, are the major players now? I know only the name Chaitin. You mentioned a few others... You do hint at ``some of the big problems...``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMaybe you know of a good (historically-inclined) book  ``The history of recursion theory``?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn a more humorous take on the matter: the random wiki-student who bumps into ``recursion theory`` might ask: ``When I grow up (choose a college, pick a field of study, declare my major, become more theoretical than computer science) I want to be a mathematician  why would I want to be a recursion theorist?`` I think the answer is: ``Because you get to work on some really cool unsolved problems.`` The kid asks: ``Yeah, such as? Explain...`` My dad was an actuary. ``What the hell is an 'actuary'?`` I used to wonder. In 3rd grade I told people he sold insurance. Then when I got in high school he showed me his books of mortality tables: he definitely did not ignite in his son the fiery actuarial spark. How do you ignite the fire in the mathematics student? Hope some of this helps. wvbailey `;1063;1.0

The fact remains that we Pashtuns rule the country with the help of Pakistan, which is equipped with 100s of nuclear bombs and very supportive of Pashtuns...hahahahahahaha  09:32, 31 October 2006;2328;1.0

'   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Hi, I request you to unprotect Konkani article and add Kannada script by yourself. ``Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Acedemy`` has declared Kannada as the official script for Konkani in Karnataka which makes Kannada script perfectly suitable in the article. Thanks. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Hi admin, Perhaps its necessary to include Kannada script for Konkani.But as u see,Konkani is the official language of Goa,it uses Roman/Devnagari script.Malyalam script is also used to write Konkani so please add them.NEWLINE_TOKENSarvagnya's comments about Belgaum issue as usual not to be taken seriously. People like sarvagnya are quite worried when the matter is with SUPREME COURT OF INDIA.This issue is quite important and u can check it by googling!Thanks. NEWLINE_TOKEN::The page is not locked, you can add it yourself. As for the Supreme Court, it hears the most important disputes, but there are also lots of obscure things that get little press attention either...'   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Indian caste system ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUsing the same ridiculous logic you blocked me for ``anti-Semitic trolling``, you yourself should be desysopped for ``pro-Zionist trolling.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway, can you have a look at the Talk:Indian caste system? We have a dispute that is currently unresolved and the mediation cabal has not responded. Be neutral please.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Well, you can start an arbitration then. On me.. and possibly on the whole Indian relgion editing group...I can't see any voluntary un-deadlocking in the near future...'   NEWLINE_TOKEN::In case you can't tell, I was being sarcastic. There was no ``anti-Semitic trolling`` on my part nor any ``pro-Zionist trolling`` on yours. Do I think you made a huge mistake, especially calling my comments ``anti-Semitic trolling``? Certainly.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Users with little to contribute to the encyclopedia will always make emoty threats.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Users with little else to do than troll will always make personal attacks.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Lets ask any neutral user which of us has made more contribs to wiki (me of course). Good job describing yourself in the above comment.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::WP:NPA - Both of you in some measure NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== I'm positive you've been asked this before... ==NEWLINE_TOKEN...but why have you blanked your userpage? Was the vandalism that bad? Oh, and if you haven't been able to chase up a reason for Bravada's untimely departure, I think - based on his final contribs - that it was due to some issues over his views VS those of others about Polish politics, which seem at the moment to be very nearly a blood sport. Not yet as bad as the Hungarian kind, but certainly heading in that direction.  -  NEWLINE_TOKEN:I haven't looked that carefully, but Bravada didn't explicitly say what the issue was. As far as some clashes between Polish and Russian editors go, on DYK for example, everybody thinks there is a big problem, but these days seeing two guys claiming the other is adding Polish/Soviet ``propaganda`` doesn't seem that inflammatory to me. Perhaps they should edit religion articles....I wasn't even aware of any Hungarian editors around the place.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:It seems to work fine. '   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Re:Maurya==NEWLINE_TOKENHi - ``Maurya`` is a relatively common surname amongst Indians. I was actually hesitant to add that sentence because I had gotten confused accounts, with one claiming that Mahinda was Ashoka's brother. Btw, I hope you're keeping an eye on Vietnam - I can use any information you can give as I prepare it for FAC. Cheers,  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And please take that miserable wikibreak notice down! You make 50 edits a day - I wouldn't call that a ``wikibreak.`` ``Will be back on Wikipedia ????`` What a joke! You haven't even left!  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Portal:Maharashtra==NEWLINE_TOKENHow about changing the content sometimes? The portal has remained almost static.  NEWLINE_TOKEN: Uh yeah, I just put up the featured content there by default. I haven't implemented a rotation because there seems to be only one set of featured material. Of course, you are welcome to initiate change. Also, I seem to be tied up too much updating WP:DYK and then running through my watchlist, and checking up on too many people who are destined for arbnitration. '   NEWLINE_TOKEN== Sarvagnya's incivil language and misuse of popups ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear admin,NEWLINE_TOKENSarvagnya is back with its rude language and misuse op popups. He is not discussing anything on talk page and just mindlessly reverting Belgaum_border_dispute. I have been adding info on the same article using Marathi newspapers but I have also taken care so as to avoid POV. Utcursh had himself checked the article 2 days back. As a revenge Gnanipati has added stuff from a Kannada newspaper (even though Deccan Herald which is in English and publishes similar pro-K'taka news exists) but with POV and biases. I was just trying to tone down 1-2 sentences when Sarvagnya without any discussion (apart from filthy comments about Shivaji Maharaj  which was answered back in similar manner) jumped and is been reverting the article. Please see 1 and 2. I am avoiding furthur edits so as to avoid 3RR.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKannada editors should understand that i can add similar POV using Marathi citations.It is upon admins if they intervene it will be nice else I will be forced to add Marathi POV to balance the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm still looking into it but there seems to be a new burst of rowdyness....*sigh*....'   NEWLINE_TOKEN==Important==NEWLINE_TOKENIts an earnest request for ur intervention at Belgaum border dispute. Kannada editors seem to start edit wars and pushing of POV there by adding insignificant stuff. A neutral third party intervention is needed. Plz do something before we all do anything enough to get blocked!

And the only comments that this article received from actual Wiki users was to hold pending the vandalism of unsigned users. Prior to this, it received votes to keep the more truthful version of history per Marcus Pan and others, all of which was very obviously reverted by Edward Douglas a few months back. He signed his own edits as well as his website admin and customer service agent. If you can prove the changes you keep making are NOT promotional, and are indeed FACT, I will concede, but you cannot.

The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.NEWLINE_TOKENI am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) ```;2059;1.0

85288492;```accompanied by personal accusations against the deleted texts' authors.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll of which were and are true. Bias from friends of the article's focus as the Chief Disemvowler of the Internet. Hostile deletions? I find this same thing goes on all over Wikipedia. People lord over their edits and fight anyone who comes along with a change ouraged that anyone dare contest their judgment. It amazes me how quickly the response to an insult gets top billing and the original infraction is swept under the cyber rug, but this happens in the world often. If blogs and forums can be used as sources after all this fuss, then the battle of the last few months on this article was a bigger waste of time than it felt like. Apparently the rules of content bend under group advocacy pressure. Nothing new about that either. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`;2315;1.0

85781248;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet's put it this way Flo, everyone has talked past me here for months. It is absolutely frustrating to have everything I contribute get labeled as ``disruptive.`` Disruptive, how? Tedentious, how? I sure as heck don't feel that I have done so because as far as I'm concerned I've acted in good faith trying to make Wikipedia the best it can be.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you want to explain the rules to me and how I can be who I am on Wikipedia and stay within the rules, I'm all ears. I just want FM to leave me alone. How would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you have done such a good job explaining everything to me, then why do I feel that I've been ganged up on without just cause? I know a lot of people who feel that Wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion that's not very positive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy not listen to me? What do you all have to lose? My faith is the core of my being, and it's who I am. Do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to Wikipedia? Have any of you stopped to consider how your own worldviews contributes to how you interpret the rules?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDo you care how ordinary readers view Wikipedia? You probably do, or else you wouldn't be here. The fact is traditionally minded Christians number over 1 billion people on this planet, and close to 100 million in the United States alone. That's not some tiny crackpot minority out there. If I feel attacked by Wikipedia, or feel that my POV is misrepresented, how do you think they feel reading Wikipedia?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet's face it here, factually, the perspective represented in the articles in the Dominionism series, from my perspective, seem to overemphasize the views of a small minority in the United States regarding the Christian Right. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy should my work be reversed when I elaborate on the Dominionist's POV, which BTW, I don't agree with, for the sake of ensuring fairness. Or when FM, removes something I wrote from a reputable Evangelical ministry critical of Christian Reconstructionist theology? He tells me it's false or that I'm POV pushing. HOW? I cited the sources, which are widely respected in Evangelical circles.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat am I supposed to think when 2/3s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the Christian Right, who by the way are a minority of the total American population. Bush won twice because of their support and elected the GOP to Congress and a majority of the statehouses. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENKatherine Yurica's and TheocracyWatch's POV represents a MINORITY of the population. I have no idea where you live. Perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends, but they don't represent the larger picture. How is writing from the majority perspective POV pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective, considering it's the perspective of just a little over 50 percent of the American population.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI suggested banning partisanship as part of the NPOV rule and Consensus rule, but FeloniousMonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor. When he does that, what am I supposed to think about his motives? I don't know him, and he hasn't exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHave you ever stopped to think, it's not what you say, but how you say it? The tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive, and what am I supposed to think, other than what I've said ad nauseam? I feel attacked, not consulted with.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo far, I feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack. Things like WP:POV, WP:POINT etc., that get put up when I feel that I have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCould you consider rephrasing it this way, or this is how you should be doing this. That's constructive in my view. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInstead of hurling rules at me, the interpretations of which I disagree with, tell me why you think I stepped over the line and your rationale. I react positively to reasoned explanations, not summary reversals of my work, accusations of POV pushing, etc., without explanation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMaybe you've been at this for awhile, so you take things for granted. I simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from. Interpretation my friend. I want to understand your interpretation, and why you interpret the rules the way you do.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEvery time I do anything, from asking people what they think about the rules, or my ideas for improving Wikipedia, I get written up on this RfC. Flo, please don't take this personally,  NEWLINE_TOKEN90 percent of the time, I simply forget to login, not thinking there is any problem with my editing without logging in. This accusation of sockpuppetry against me is baseless. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wish I didn't feel that there was a partisan atmosphere here, but the behavior here hasn't been conducive to what I see as mature discussions.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy can't you accept my comments as constructive criticism in the other direction, instead of taking them personally? If people here were a bit more reasonable with me in explaining why they think what they think,instead of treating me like a threat there wouldn't be a problem.NEWLINE_TOKENExplain that one to me adult to adult. I get sick of being accused of this or having everything I do put up for an RfC. What am I supposed to think about your motives when everything I write gets labeled as POV pushing, etc.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou tell me to add things to the articles that balance things out. I do that, yet FM constantly reverses everything I do, attacks me personally, etc. If that were you, how would you feel? Try putting yourself into my shoes for a change? `;609;1.0

86285940;`GD Thank you.  However, I prefer to point out Wikipedia Cuba and related pages have many factual errors on Cuba.  The problem is that one cannot rely on official Cuban sources, nor to a somewhat lesser extent can one rely on the international media since all who enter Cuba this way do so after screening by the Cuban government.  Thus what is ``verifiable fact`` like that I placed above is from an official Cuban government source, and thus by definition unreliable.  Thus to limit discussion on Cuba to ``verifiable fact`` means that this page will, until things change on the   island, merely reflect official Cuban government propaganda.    An example will follow.  El Jigue 11-7-06NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`;2803;1.0

I am sure you are mature enough to tolerate this as not whitewashing and not demonizing you, but I can put up a wikipedia article and post all your misdemenaours and actions in your log history there if you want.

87978464;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Etiquette==NEWLINE_TOKENYour statement ``I keep my conviction that I'm on the truth: that you two are members of some racist organization`` on this edit directed toward User:Dark Tichondrias  is an accusation that two users are racists, making it against Wikipedia's policy on etiquette.  Wikipedia's policy on etiquette suggests to not accuse other users of being racist. NEWLINE_TOKEN:WP:Wikiettiquete says:NEWLINE_TOKEN::Terms like ``racist,`` ``sexist`` or even ``poorly written`` make people defensive. This makes it hard to discuss articles productively. If you have to criticize, you must do it in a polite and constructive manner.NEWLINE_TOKEN:This seems to be the issue of dispute. Yet racism is at the heart of this discussion, specially because DT and Thulean are percieved by all the rest as people with such an agenda. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm pondering to start a project called WP:Honesty: Say things clear (without falling in insults), don't hide in word games, don't make threats that make no sense (bravados), don't edit capriciously ignoring the discussion, etc. Play fair and demand others to do the same. NEWLINE_TOKEN:You pretend that I'm making ad hominem attacks, yet I'm just pointing out who's misbehaving and why. Something that is obvious to all, including you two.NEWLINE_TOKEN:If you would be even minimally sincere you would not be trying to corner me against arbitrarily selected Wikipolicies but you would have protested your innocence, first of all. You are just playing legalism.NEWLINE_TOKEN:If you want me to refrain from denouncing your behaviour and your agenda the least your could do is to  is to protest your innocence, to explain your reasons, to pretend at least that you are not racist. But you only make attacks ad hominem against my honesty and sincerity.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Keep it that way. I don't mind.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Personal Attacks==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease refrain from personal attacks which you made in Talk:White_people. Or next time you will be reported to WP:DP.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:I am not making any personal attacks. I honestly think you are a nazi (or close equivalent, if you want to dwell in the small letter and word twists). You haven't even bothered in denying it, so why should I think otherwise. NEWLINE_TOKEN:If you think that stating that is a personal attack, please say why. I don't think that openly declaring the (apparent) truth is any personal attack but just that: stating facts, so we can discuss honestly.NEWLINE_TOKEN:What is being discussed in that article's talk page is largely ideological and some people of certain ideology (you and DarkTichondrias) are trying to manipulate the participative process of Wikipedia in your favor, editing ignoring the consensus. I honestly believe it is my duty to fight such behaviour and defend the neutrality of Wikipedia. And I will do it.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:If you still arent satisfied, you can ask a request for investigation, but I must warn it can well backfire.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOf course I wont dignify your silly personal attacks with a response. And you repeated your personal attack with your response. I'll be reporting you.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Excellent.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCalling another editor a nazi, regardless of whether you think it is true, is completely unacceptable.  If you continue, you may be blocked for personal attacks.  Please find a more civil way to discuss your concerns about the article.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Please stop. If you continue to make personal attacks on other people, you will be blocked for disruption. Comment on content, not on other contributors or people. Thank you.

If you continue to make personal attacks on other people, you will be blocked for disruption. Comment on content, not on other contributors or people. Thank you.  By saying things like ``Nevertheless I will keep protecting the article against unilateral harassment by Thulean, who obviously is not interested in reaching any consensus but just imposing his opinion and (unspeakable) ideology by any means at reach``, you are still implying I'm a Nazi and that is a personal attack. Concentrate on debate, on the text, not me.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==White People==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease stop. If you continue to vandalize pages, as you did to White people, you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou may delete uncited or incorrectly cited meterial. But deleting whole cited sections (population section) is considered vandalism.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I am not vandalizing but editing in agreement with consensus. You are POV-pushing it and acting unilaterally. NEWLINE_TOKEN:I'm not worried about your threats. You can't block me: you would have to initiate an investigation, what I will be glad to be involved in such process as it might help to solve the conflicts the disputed article is involved in. (And I guess it will be you who may be disciplined instead). NEWLINE_TOKEN:Stop spamming my user page and keep the discussion civil and in its proper place: the corresponding article's talk page. Thanks.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think you have to report warnings to users talk page. Anyway, I reported you. NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN:Thanks. It's the first time in 2 years that anybody reports me. I have mixed feelings about it but I feel that I have acted in full accordance with Wikipedia's spirit. So I have no fear.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour RFI seems to have been resolved before I found out about it. I tend to agree with you, it was little more than a time wasting excersise. It also beggs the question, is it an attack to infer someone's political sympathies, surely it's only an attack when it's meant to be offensive or insulting? I'm a bit concerned generally, Wikipedia seems to be overrun with racists at the moment, I don't know if it is a concerted effort, or if it's just that they've discovered it as a way to promote their vile ideology, but still there seems to be a lot of racist/racialist opinion creeping onto quite a lot of pages at the moment. Oh well, all we do is follow proper wiki procedures, they should be robust enough to stop neo-fascist ideology from being promoted. I wondered what you might think of this paper Categorization of humans in biomedical research: genes, race and disease, it's cited in the Race and multilocus allele clusters. Personally I think this sort of paper is very dangerous, if scientists want to define human populations in this way I think they should avoid the loaded word race, and emphasis the small nature of geographic variability.

I'll look for appropiate spaces. What was of Wikipedians against Racism?.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Regarding the paper: it's disputable. Some population clustering is a fact and it may be relevant to dealing with certain diseases (for instance Western Eurasians and specially Basques have high Rh disease probability, while East Asians and Native Americans don't - Africans are intermediate), the re are other papers that dispute this (on the grounds that race classification, as arbitrary as it is, provides no valid medical info and that many of these ``racial diseases`` actually overflow any racial/ethnic border in most cases) and is a subject of current debate. NEWLINE_TOKEN:The article doesn't seem to have been attacked by ``white nationalists`` who would probably consider it ``too pro-Caucasoid`` and therefore against their pseudo-Europeist approach to ``white race``.  `;2944;1.0

That was my first attempt at editing Wikipedia and it wasn't an 'experiment,' I saw something that sounded ludicrous, fact-checked it, and included the relevant info with a source. It'll also be my last attempt at editing Wikipedia, as I see that the stuff I've heard about anal-retentive fanboys who refuse to allow their personal Sacred Pages to be edited by Anyone But Them are completely true.

88962731;`For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems:NEWLINE_TOKEN``In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, ``The Living Legend,`` guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSpecial effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIIRC, Cylon.org had a page on this at one time, but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared.

NEWLINE_TOKEN:I also find very sad that no other administrator has dared to intervene even when the case is so clearly a policy violation. I am offering an exit in good terms but as wikipedian I can't but follow the correct procedures outlined in the relevant policy pages and I hope that you do the same, because, as administrator you must abide to policy as much or even more than the common user.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I am getting more and more worried at the apparent arbitrarity displayed and what seems a fear of retaliation felt by some administrators. As compromised wikipedian I can't but fight that with the means that policy allows. It's not just my pride, my feelings or anything of the like: it is Wikipedia and Wikipedia's pillars what are at the stake.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Really sorry we are at this stage, really, I used to have a high esteem of administrators and Wikipedia community rule and I still hope this faith in Wikipedia will be restored, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, maybe in a few years.

89272778;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I just noticed this reply. I never said they were copying off the website. What I am getting at is there has been considerable discussion about removing famous alumnae sections all together... There is no reason to have a great big list full of people who do not have wiki articles when they can just go to the link provided and read more about them there. This list pushes wikipedia guidelines and can be easily deleted citing anything on WP:NOT. When deleting the red links there's less reason given for deletion of that particular section. As for the ``nobody's going to look and see?`` That's right they haven't said it's a very good organization but there have been instances where people have deleted the famous alumnae/alumni sections due to the fact that it's over red linked, and as a list doesn't really belong on wikipedia. (WP:NOT Wikipedia is not a directory, it is not the white pages, it is not a repository of links (internal or external) etc.) Which is why I continue to remove the red linked people. And finally wikipedia is not a rush brochure I know you're proud of your sorority but that doesn't mean that every person that can be considered famous needs to be put in this list. Thanks.  `;1618;1.0

On the other hand, I have impression that you agreed to put  national versions there in the text, so I follow this solution (even if I feel that WP:NC(GN) suggests something else).

89746496;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Cdn Armed Forces template==NEWLINE_TOKENHello JesseW, sorry it took me so long to reply but RL has such an annoying way of cutting down on my wiki time. I replied on my page but here is a copy of my reply:  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I like your historical point of view but a fondamental principle of Wikipedia is: Guidelines are a product of community consensus, as can be seen at Wikipedia:How_to_create_policy#Guidelines_for_creating_policies_and_guidelines and Wikipedia:Consensus. The communinty has evolved, the babel boxes have become userboxes and we are using them differently now. Therefore, without some consensus, I feel the major change you made to the userbox was hasty. Changing a ``I support the army`` to ``I want to write about the cdn army`` is a conceptual leap for most userbox users. I recommend a new userbox as another option for users interested in the project. On a different note, I personally feel your statement is implied and doesn't need to be spelled out... it just makes the userbox too wordy       Of course I'm here to write and edit about the subjects I care about!

It is not a fantasy football league.  The UFL is a full-contact, tackle football league based in Macungie, PA, that attracts teenagers (ranging from 9th to 12th graders) from all over the Lehigh Valley.  There are referees, statisticians, an official rulebook, and permenant teams.  It is not just a hobby that was created without any sort of solid foundation.  It's website is growing rapidly, with nearly 6000 hits since the beginning of October.  Merely because it is local and young, does not mean that it doesn't hold a solid enough position in the world to have a Wikipedia page.  Your response to the Perl citation was a weak showing of how the UFL did not deserve a page.  Perhaps there are people who are very interested in football.  They might be interested in seeing how leagues in other areas.  If someone has a vested interest in something, they should be allowed to access information about it.  Isn't that what Wikipedia is all about?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, merely because you have a personal vendetta against TheCommish21 does not mean that you have the right to block him and deny his appeal to be unblocked.  And you and WarthogDemon both know that he never referred to you as ``cyberidiots.``  The term was ``cyber police.``  I don't understand how you can hold yourself in such high esteem if you are lowering yourself to mocking those whom you have problems with.  You should have allowed an unbiased administrator to approve or deny the appeal, and you should not have just gone ahead and done it yourself.  Also, you block over 30 people per day.  Has that always been necessary?  If this is how you're really running things, don't expect my support. -`;561;1.0

Most of your additions are not appropriate the articles. A few wikipedia users removed or adjusted your additions, and I removed most of the rest. Please do not continue to add links to these images, it is considered spam. Images must be directly referenced in articles, or have highly contextual representation in order to be included. Good practice is to looks at an article and see if it can benefit from the inclusion of an image - then go out and find one that fits well. Bad practice is to start with an image and see where on wikipedia you can put it. If you need help deciding if an image should be included, please ask me or others on wikipedia/  ;1824;1.0

91661938;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think it is a disgrace and irresponsible on the part of the user (CliffC) to delete the changes I made last week in attempt to correct this TOTALLY INCORRECT article THAT HAS NOW RETURNED TO WIKIPEDIA IN ITS ORIGINAL INCORRECT FORMAT. I'd like to see what qualifications CliffC has as a journalist (I would guess none by reading his work), but we'll never know, as he's too cowardly to post an email address so I can ask. I spent years researching the Haunted Castle, and HAVE PUBLISHED AN AWARD-WINNING DOCUMENTARY ON THE SUBJECT, so how could it be unverifiable? All of my information was cited as such. This user should stop making changes to this article, as it clear he has NO IDEA at all what he's talking about, as the current article looks like a child wrote it, and is TOTALLY INCORRECT IN MANY AREAS.

91811856;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFriends the future of wikipedia lies in united or collaborative work, only thus will we be able to counter the extreme Communist and Neo-Liberal views that have brought about so much disaster and instability in world, it concerns me greatly to see these same poisonous views being expressed by irresponsible (or worse) users in these pages. I call for the formation of an international working group of users whose political and social vision is grounded in tradition, faith (Roman Catholic preferable, though all Christian groups welcome), physical and mental discipline. I await your considered responses. P.S. besides English, I am fluent in Castilian (mother tongue), French, and can read German. I also understand Italian, Latin, Portuguese, and Romanian.

I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by ``reverting the article upside down``; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.NEWLINE_TOKENHowever, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)NEWLINE_TOKENI am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWith Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.NEWLINE_TOKENFinaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves.

Although the Arbitration Committee has ruled that ``[t]he occasional light use of cross-posting to talk pages is part of Wikipedia's common practice``1, such cross-posting should adhere to specific guidelines found in Wikipedia:Spam.  In the past, aggressively worded cross-posting has contributed towards an Arbitration Committee ruling of disruptive behavior that resulted in blocking2.  It is best not to game the system, and instead respect Wikipedia's principle of consensus-building, by ceasing to further crosspost, and instead allowing the process to reflect the opinions of editors that were already actively involved in the matter at hand.

Indeed, I don't offer any pay services from my website itself, and never have. Ever.  The sites I've removed as repeated spam link abuse sites are www.otrsite.com, libsyn.com, www.freeotrshows.com, and www.otr.net, for the most part.  As is obvious, both www.otrsite.com and libsyn.com are commercial sites, pure and simple. Libsyn.com in particular is enjoying unfettered spam link abuse on Wikipedia, to the tune of over 270 gratuitious and self-promoting Wikipedia linksfor free. At least those are the ones PrinceAl continues to revert without citing his rationale for violating Wikipedia Link Spam and External Linking guidelines.  This is simply a revisiting of the issues raised over six months ago, which I'd assumed were resolved, by consensus.  Apparently that's no longer the case.

93369772;`:This is my second message on this topic. You are currently engaged in a revert war over a link that you have not made a single arguement on the talk page to justify or remove. Your only arguement currently has been ``We have an article on the timeline. I'm not sure we need a link here at all. Tom Harrison Talk ``, which is not based on any policy or guideline. WP:EL does not require the link to contain information not in any other Wikipedia article, but to contain information relevant to the current article that could not be covered in it once it reaches Featured Article status, which CR does. CR provides a more detailed timeline then can ever be provided inside the article, and further that is shown simpyl by the existence of a timeline article. If th einformation in CR could be included in the article, we would not have a split off article obviously. So I ask you to participate on the talk page and use Wikipedia guidelines and policies to make your arguement as it would be more pursuasive then simpyl reverting without explanation based on more then personal opinion and feelings.

The fact that it was undisputed before 2004 or whenever could mean that Larry Sanger was the co-founder. It could also mean that Jimbo didn't see it that way but didn't want to be a dick until things got strained between them. It could be that Jimbo didn't CARE as long as Larry was helping Wikipedia, but now that he's running Citizendium and is making all these loud noises about how his will be teh bettars, Jimbo sees no reason to allow Larry a false prop. That's what I mean about how they have to work it out. The only NPOV way to handle it is to state the bald facts: that Larry Sanger asserts he is a cofounder, which Jimmy Wales says is untrue.

Don't you realize that many people might be coming to see this discussion here? You are basically telling everyone here not to trust the CIA, BBC, United Nations' 2006 chart that is posted above, which is also posted at BBC, and that everyone should trust your 1980 map which was made by an unknown person. First of all, I am not arguing over the number of each ethnic group but instead you are. I never changed the numbers, rather I changed and replaced the old 1980, hard to read and understand map of yours. My map, the one above, explains little more about each Ethnic group, while yours does not. Demographics of Afghanistan should not just be the numbers of each group but also include a brief explanation about who or what these people are and or where they originate from. By watching your actions and you keep insisting that your map remains in Afghanistan's article, there must be something you are up to. Also something I noticed, you keep talking about the numbers of Pashtuns should be lower, which indicates that you wish to see them die or something. I will slowly look around for an administrator to help with removing and deleting your silly outdated man soon. I wish not to bother talking or discussing anything with you as I find that you are not a nice person to talk or socialize with. You keep reminding that Pashtuns killed this Pashtuns killed that, why don't you discuss about Pashtuns always being killed by invaders. They have the right to rule their country and they have the right to kill anyone they find as a traitor to their country. This law is practiced in all the countries of the world. By now I've already realized that you are not just a traitor to Afghanistan but also a true enemy of Pashtuns. I have Allah (Almighty God) on my side and that's why I always win. ;3470;1.0

95254731;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== sockpuppets ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia has always been biased, starting from the top (Jimbo Wales ran an Ayn Rand mailing list for years, said ``[Friedrich] Hayek’s work...is central to my own thinking about how to manage the Wikipedia project.`` etc.) on down, it used to pretend it was fair and balanced though.  I was accused for years of having sock puppets.  As things went downhill here (or uphill from their perspective), they began checking into the accusations of the wing nuts that I had sock puppets, and repeatedly found nothing.  Finally, things degenerated to the point where David Gerard, who has checkuser privileges, claimed I was someone named .  I have no association with Mr. Know-It-All, but even that aside, there is no rule on Wikipedia that you can't have multiple accounts.  So he claimed we had voted on multiple RFA's together, and due to that I was put on probation.  Well, a simple comparison of two pages of the RFA's I and he voted on can be done, and it can be seen that his claim there were multiple RFA's the two accounts voted on is false, or that Me and Mr. KIA ever voted on the same RFA ever, not even one, never mind the multiple he said happened.  The rules say he had to post the links in the page, but since the links did not exist, since the charge was false, that didn't happen.  So they broke their own rules of prosecution, presenting no evidence, and then convicted me on a charge where anyone comparing two pages in the space of a minute can see is false.  Of course my pointing this out before the case was closed was completely ignored.  Basically, I followed the rules but they didn't like my politics so I was punished for that.  The leaps of logic where strange too - I tried to point out that the US supported the ``Khmer Rouge`` after 1979, which somehow made me responsible for everyone who died in Cambodia prior to 1979.  And that sort of thing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia is what it is, thinking you can fix it is like thinking you can fix Fox News by leaving comments in their web site comments section before they're erased.  Demopedia and dKosopedia or something of that ilk might become an alternative.

Newman's newspaper responded to Berlet, and if King doesnt like the response that has nothing to do with whether or not a biography should include it. Berlet's own Wikipedia page has a string of accusations from his critics, for which you could make the same argument, yet they are included. And Dennis King should try and stick to discussing particulars, rather than take every opportunity to spew his irrational hatred for Newman all over this discussion. The fact that he hasnt been able to find a publisher for any of his writings on Newman for close to 30 years is no excuse for him to clog up this discussion page with his fulminations.

Think of it as getting in shape for football season, and think of how you'll feel next Bedlam Series knowing that OSU was never on the front page of Wikipedia (do I sound a bit biased?  like maybe I personally want you to do it?  yes).    ;1840;1.0

The false accusation of NOR, given uncivilly, should be addressed. It was followed by the report I made at NOR (in which he 1) didn't even try to argue that there was a NOR issue after making the accusation 2) did not apologize to the accused user for the false accusation. Along with discussions at EL, it clearly demonstrates that JSmith was aware there 1) was public opposition both to the project and how it was being conducted, and 2) there was public opposition to how complaints regarding valid links were handled/how other editors were mistreated/community editing was disrespected. In spite of this public opposition, the project, how it was conducted, and how editors with objections/community editing were treated continued unchanged.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet's summarize:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*1. there was opposition to project itself/how it was conductedthe project began without consensus, against established policy.NEWLINE_TOKEN*2. there was oppostion to how users with objections regarding valid links were treated/the disruptive effect this had on community editing at numerous articles.

(Although both are user conduct issues there is no policy dispute. Copyright policy is clear, and they made no attempt to change it/discuss changing it. They cited the EL guideline as standard justification, without consensus, and directly against consensus after it was made clear at EL that no one agreed with a blanket You Tube ban, that links should be evaluated by article editors on a case-by-case basis, via editorial judgement and consensus. The extremely troubling incidents are not the ones in which they deleted suspected copyvios (although there is opposition to that/they do not have consensus and are acting procedurally against both C and EL)the extremely troubling incidents are the ones in which they continued to delete links they KNEW were NOT copyvios,  and how they treated other editors/the community in the process (bullying, false accusations, etcDcmdevit's comments to Argyiou, JSmith's ``NOR``) and disrupted Wikipedia in violation of WP:POINT.NEWLINE_TOKEN `;3944;1.0

Moreover, you can't even apply your ``logic`` consistently  Apparently, it seems quite reasonable for a 9/11 Conspiracies encyclopedia page to discuss, at length, claims about a remote-controlled rocket having hit the Pentagon, and other unlikely scenarios for which there is a complete ``absence of evidence,`` than for this espionage puzzle, for which there is some evidence, and an interesting flurry of mainstream media attention, but not yet enough evidence for a firm judgement.

I'd like on on pseudophilosophy and Patrecia Scott as Alienus is using new sockpuppets to edit these. Thanks.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHello: this request for semi-protection on two articles is out of process  the user making the request is in a content dispute with multiple editors, and has provided no valid evidence, nor requested Checkuser to support the claim that any banned sockpuppets are editing. Editing from anon-IPs is not reason enough; particularly when the request for semi-protection comes from an editor with a  who wishes to protect his version of the article. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Most requests for administrative intervention come from editors with an interest in the topic.  That doesn't invalidate the request, or change the fact that Alienus is not permitted to edit Wikipedia by the order of the Arbcom.  Hope that helps.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::There's been no actual evidence that any vandalism or editing by Alienus has occurred at those articles. Claiming an IP address is a banned user without proof is inappropriate, and contrary to semi-protection policy, which states,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Semi-protection should not be used:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::*As a preemptive measure against vandalism before any vandalism has occurred.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*As a response to regular content disputes, since it may restrict some editors and not others (see the protection policy for how to deal with this).NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*In the case of a static IP vandal hitting a page (blocking is preferable to semi-protection).NEWLINE_TOKEN:::...NEWLINE_TOKEN:::*To prohibit anonymous editing in general.NEWLINE_TOKEN:: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: I'm pretty satisfied that the thing that is quacking, waddling, and shedding feathers is, in fact, a duck.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::When making a claims contrary to WP:AGF, it might be a good idea to actually have evidence. Can you show any edit in the  recent history of Pseudophilosophy that was either 1) vandalism or 2) an edit by a banned user? Likewise, can you show that in  Patrecia Scott  IPs 207.210.106.104 or  128.197.11.30 are the banned user Alienus, as claimed? All I see is a content dispute, and edit-warring by LaszloWalrus and for that you are not permitted to semi-protect an article. In fact, the content in the latter article that LaszloWalrus keeps removing is in the Nathaniel Branden article: ``In 1968, the close relationship between Rand and Branden came to an abrupt end when Rand discovered that Branden was having a sexual relationship with a third woman, actress Patrecia Scott. Rand then expelled Branden from the Objectivist movement.`` NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: Look more closely.  Good day.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::: That certainly is not an answer; it's your responsibility to demonstrate that you're using Admin powers appropriately. If necessary, I'll bring this up at RFC for Admin conduct. NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: I encourage you to do whatever you think is best.  Regards,  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::Umm, I'm editing Pseudophilosophy and the gentleman in question seems only to remove the sections that he does not support.  Most of that is cited material, or documented on Ayn Rand's own page.  It is not novel or disputed, just not liked.  I think we need to be wary of such edits and protections.  If he is doing this elsewhere, that is even more problematic.  I have noticed that at least one time he reverted on the basis of 'alienus' from an anon ip, it did not look like a sockpuppet edit, and i think the continued use of this justification is being used as a trope for a campaign.  It should be ignored and forgotten.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::: It's accepted practice to treat anonymous IP edits that closely parallel those made by banned users as sockpuppet edits.  There really is no controversy here at all.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::*Actually, that is not ``accepted practice``  and is contrary to WP:SOCK which notes, NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::::::``Keep in mind there can be multiple users who are driven to start participating in Wikipedia for the same reason, particularly in controversial areas such as articles about the conflict in the Middle East, cult figures, or Articles for deletion. Some have suggested applying the 100-edit guideline more strongly in such cases, assuming that all accounts with fewer than 100 edits are sock puppets. Generally, such beliefs have been shown to be not well-founded.`` (emphasis mine.) NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::::The proper way to handle suspicions of sockpuppetry is to use Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets, which details the requirements for evidence  which neither you nor LaszloWalrus have yet provided. NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::::: The arbitration committee disagrees with your interpretation.  Best regards,  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:*Then you appear to have some fundamental misunderstandings of Wikipedia policy. ArbCom does not ``disagree with [my] interpretation.`` ArbCom does not have ongoing opinions about anything. As noted at Arbitation Policy rules, ``Former decisions will not be binding on the Arbitrators - rather, they intend to learn from experience.``  While there is a list of past principles, the top of which clearly states, ``Note that the Arbitration Committee is not bound by precedent.`` You may, perhaps, be referring to the past decision principal under ``Sockpuppets`` which included the point ``For the purpose of dispute resolution when there is uncertainty whether a party is one user with sockpuppets or several users with similar editing habits they may be treated as one user with sockpuppets.`` Note the first clause ``For the purpose of dispute resolution``  your actions as an admin were not part of dispute resolution, nor are you a member of ArbCom involved in deciding a case.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Your protections of particular articles were contrary to the principals of WP:PPOL, ``Admin powers are not editor privileges — admins should only act as servants to the user community at large. If you are an admin and you want a page in an edit war in which you are somehow involved to be protected, you should request protection in the way a normal user would. Admins should avoid favouring one version of the article over another in general.``.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: Your objections are noted, and I continue to disagree. I don't really have anything more to say about this issue. To me, it's cut and dry: a banned user is using Tor to abuse Wikipedia, and he will be stopped. End of story.NEWLINE_TOKEN::: Feel free to respond as much as you like on this page, but I believe I've explained my position on ths matter adequately.  `";2149;1.0
98357800;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Hello Gwernol ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am glad to be back at wikipedia again, after being rudely blocked for a month for little to no reason. I assure you I will do exactly what I did before being blocked, that is, only contribute to wikipedia. I write this to you, because I want you to know that I think your actions were irresponsible, and only furthered my theory that many wikipedia admins are pompous and overzealous. I don't want to offend you in any way, because I know you would be prone to blocking me if I did. I want you to at least understand my point of view, being that you acted irresponsibly. If you don't want to listen to me, I understand. If you never want to speak to me again, I understand. I just feel I was mistreated, and that if you are as responsible as you think you are, you would at least try to make it right. Again, no offense should be taken from this, I just want to talk.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWith all due respect,NEWLINE_TOKEN ;214;1.0

98361493;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think you are insistent on including Maddin's support of gay rights because you have described yourself as gay and its an important issue to you personally. Does it deserve a mention in an information piece on Jim Maddin though? No. He contributed $2000 to a gay rights group.......this is insignifigant compared to his other accomplishments and other facts about his life, such as winning the mayoralty race in Saskatoon. Lets face it, he's not known specifically for this. You include it only because its a cause of your own and aren't objectively viewing this piece on Maddin. If he gave $2000 to the Heart and Stroke foundation, I highly doubt you would include that in the article on him, correct?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for Maddin being disappointed, he most certainly was, especially the first time. CJCurrie, you need to face the fact that not only did he lose, but he lost even Jim Pankiw, a very controversial politician as you very well know. Finishing third in his first re-election bid was described by himself as very disappointing (to say the least) and here is an article describing his latest effort at getting elected civically, if you care to read it:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENhttp://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/story.html?id=bcdb8a12-e327-4484-905e-2c5e37ec8a46NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN ;3219;1.0

No one explained which clause of the innumerable rules I broke - it's so much more convenient to call someone a spammer after doing a 2 second Google search.

You may want to read his own biography and look at his family photos at [56].NEWLINE_TOKEN:What exactly the autobiography is supposed to prove? That he wrote German. And where he identifies himself as German? And what the photos suppose to proof?NEWLINE_TOKEN>He himself states that his mother Maria and father Simon had a small farm in the same place in Silesia. In other words they were longtime burghers of Silesia, as well as him.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Yes there was. “Name of his great-grandfather Jerzy (1717-1800) appears in the oldest Polish chronicles of Lowkowitz “(W. Kocowicz 1987).NEWLINE_TOKEN>You look at the church records with birth, marriage, death from Lowkowitz and surrounding area and all his Dzierzon family members, who all wound up after 1945 in Western Germany and you find no traces at all of either him or his parents having moved from Poland to Silesia, Germany.NEWLINE_TOKEN:It only proof that the official language was German and Germanization was on the way look V. Raczek, Erinnerungeu all den Altmelster der Bienenzuclit Dr. DzierzonNEWLINE_TOKEN>His grave stone also identifies him as Johann Dzierzon.NEWLINE_TOKEN:The grave stone is repeatedly mentioned by many as proof. The stone was funded by Austrian Beekeepers’ Association and have nothing to do with Dzierzon’s family will. I already mentioned about it in earlier part of the discussion. Lokk up.NEWLINE_TOKEN>The only Polish people, who came to the Silesian town, I find reference to, is by the way on the current Polish Kluczbork.. (?) site, which tells us that Protestant Polish people took refuge there in the 1600's. We all know, that the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuits 'convinced' the Silesians and others to re-catholizise. Perhaps that is, where Johann Dzierzon had gotten his surname from.NEWLINE_TOKEN:You like to forgot that orginal population of Silesia was Polish people. Look for “Recoveret Teritories” article. The orginal Polish language survived for hundred od years. (It is not exceptional facts you can found such event on Lithuania and others countries where the native language was not changed in vilages) As you can imagine because the schools were fewer.NEWLINE_TOKEN>I have not seen any self-description of him by himself as a Pole.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I am not surprised of it. German do not publicized such thinks. You need read Polish. You have editions by Polish authors in English. You can find them in “Literature” sections. Also you disbelieve recent Polish authors but you believe on NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer (his editions are 50-70 years old). I ask many times for recent German beekeeping historians who says Jan Dzierzon was German.NEWLINE_TOKEN>The wikipedia Polish group, lead by A Serafin, who is also Nr. 131.. are the only ones with a note from a 1961 book, which is added to the incorrectly named Jan Dzierzon wikipedia article.NEWLINE_TOKEN:The correct name of Jan Dzierzon is Dzierżon the z is with dot above. “Dzierżyć” means to keep in Polish language. What do you mean a note from 1961. All Polish beekeeping historians says Dzierzon was Polish. You just disregard parts which are inconvenient.NEWLINE_TOKEN>This not only claims, that he said that, but insisting on, that he actually did say that. Where is the actual proof? NEWLINE_TOKEN:In Kluczbork museum. There is many more interesting thinks about the Polish Dzierzon family and their testimonies. I will encourage you to find proof of yours statement JD was German. Nobody yet give me one except the NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer scribbles. Autobiography do not say anything of such, we already know it, is not? NEWLINE_TOKEN>That quote, supposedly from him,'identifying himself as a Polish person', actually just says, that his surname is a Polish-based surname.NEWLINE_TOKEN:The citation say: “Regarding my nationality, I AM obviously, just as my name says, Polish of birth, since on Silesia people speak Polish…” in Polish version is: ``Samo moje nazwisko mówi, żem Polak z urodzenia`` which is “just my name says I AM Pole of birth” Further the sentence says: “because from 10 birthday I found myself in Breslau and I studied there I become German educated, but the education does not accept borders or nationality.” I did not include the other part before as I avoided irritating Germans chauvinists. Now you have it.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Original Polish text: „Co do mojej narodowości, jestem oczywiście, jak już samo nazwisko moje mówi, PolakiemNEWLINE_TOKENz urodzenia, gdyż na Śląsku mówi się po polsku, a że od 10 roku życia znalazłem się we Wrocławiu i tam studiowałem, stałem się Niemcem z wykształcenia.

Please consult the links in the tag at top and here for further information about special concerns and policies pertaining to editing such articles as this one.NEWLINE_TOKENHere is a key passage from WP:BLP:NEWLINE_TOKENEditors must take particular care when writing biographies of living persons and/or including any material related to living persons. These require a degree of sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to our content policies:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* VerifiabilityNEWLINE_TOKEN* Neutral point of viewNEWLINE_TOKEN* No original researchNEWLINE_TOKENWe must get the article right.Jimmy Wales. Keynote speech, Wikimania, August 2006.NEWLINE_TOKENBe very firm about high quality references, particularly about details of personal lives. Unsourced or poorly sourced  controversial (negative, positive, or just highly questionable) material  about living persons should be removed immediately from Wikipedia articles, talk pages, and user pages.Jimmy Wales. ``WikiEN-l Zero information is preferred to misleading or false information``, May 16, 2006 and May 19, 2006 These principles also apply to biographical material about living persons in other articles.  The responsibility for justifying controversial claims in Wikipedia, of all kinds, but especially for living people's bios, rests firmly on the shoulders of the person making the claim.  (Some italics and bold print added.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese policies are very important to keep in mind when composing and editing this article.  For example, there are some claims currently presented in this article citing sources using words like ``mendacity`` and ``lies`` in relation to what they are regarding as ``inaccuracies`` and ``mistakes`` in Carter's book or making allegations skirting on claims of plagiarism (like the parts relating to derivations of maps of Palestine), which in my view are still highly dubious, as the origin of the maps and Carter's sources of the maps still may not be the book by Ross as Ross claims, despite his claims. [E.g., Carter's source can be the one that he does cite, whereas Carter's source may have used Ross, without Carter realizing that connection.]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENQuoting sources making such claims and thus giving them attention and perhaps credence (belief in their value) without giving any support for the allegations of intentional deception on the part of the author, President Carter, is highly problematic and such references might be considered libelous and subject to deletion (see tag at top), given Wikipedia's current editing policies (see the notes to Jimmy Wales). In some instances, the allegations are quoted and then the article goes on to say that no specific evidence has been presented yet by those alleging such claims.  That material may still need to be deleted.  It is not of the ``high quality`` that adherence to current content policy in WP:BLP requires: ``Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous. If such material is repeatedly inserted or there are other concerns relative to this policy, report it on the living persons biographies noticeboard`` (see tagged links above; some italics and bold added).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo new editors: again, as I've stated earlier and in editing history comments: Please do not just toss in external links; if adding material, one needs to provide complete information about the source in a full citation in a note (prevailing format).  Anything less than that is going to be considered either ``unsourced`` or ``poorly sourced`` and subject to deletion (following Wikipedia policy just quoted). One needs to provide both reliable and verifiable sources.  External links are not enough; they do not identify clearly the nature of a source and one needs to know the authority of the source added (who the person is and what the publication is, so that one can verify and evaluate credibility). NYScholar  [Explanation: The W policy phrase ``poorly sourced`` implies a value judgment; one must evaluate sources in determining which ones to cite; not all sources are equal in value; some are more valuable (credible, authoritative) than others.

100169349;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn his ludicrous block against me Jdorney wrote the following ``Regarding the Irish Republican pages, this user pushes a POV agenda talking up the IRA's military effectiveness. He does this by inflating the casualty figures listed. He has used several methods to do this. Firstly, by changing the numbers given by sourced material, thereby falsifying it. Secondly, by inventing sources and or/citing them falsely. He refuses to engage with other users when asked detailed questions about this behaviour, but instead makes personal attacks (specifically calling users loyalist paramilitary supporters) and threatens to get other editors banned from wikipedia. This behaviour has been going on for nearly a year now and is hugely disruptive to the articles in question. This is not only due to the factual inaccuracies and POV he inserts, but also because his reverts delete all the work done on the articles since his previous edits. Additionally, his constant reverts have had the effect of re-posting copyrgiht material that had been removed. Finally, Devin79 has also defamed a living person, Irish journalist Henry McDonald, although he has not engaged in revert wars there when his edits were removed. Jdorney NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe most serious aspect of this dispute, in my opinion, is edits such as [2]. Devin79 alters properly cited figures (from BBC News [3]) about the Provisional IRA's weapons arsenal. This change was made not only without providing a reference for the different numbers, but without changing the reference itself. So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5]. Not only has Devin79 not responded to attempts by myself and other editors to engage with him on the talk page [6], but he announced his intention to keep on reverting regardless [7]. Demiurge NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese accusations are completely false, and slanderous. Every single edit I have done of the PIRA article is based on a number of sources all of which have been cited in the article edits, and source page. Jdorney has infested this article with innacuracies and outright lies, due to his biasd view of the IRA. The edits I made are proven and the proof was cited again and again. I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored.

On the other hand, it is highly disrespectful to completely ignore what others have to say by not responding to specific replies to specific requests. Several here have done this towards me, including you. Though this is regarded in academia as rude behaviour, I have voiced no feelings of persecution as though concerned about hostility or lack of hostility toward my person. If others feel somehow threatened by my presentations then they should know that I respond very well to well-researched and sound presentations.

100835055;I would like to start with your inappropriate use of my last name, several times. Please follow traditions.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Now, I learned about the Z++ page in Wikipedia from a friend. I thought I could do a better job, so I spent time to learn Wiki's features and expand on the page. As about the Google search, I have been told about references to Z++, mostly in European forums etc. In some cases that I became interested, I had to use a translator (I was shown how to do that) so I could see what was being said about Z++. Unlike you, those folks had looked at the Z++ syntax chart and were discussing its features.NEWLINE_TOKEN:About the use of .h and namespace, your are making a big guess about Z++ without first trying to understand what Z++ is. You are wrong in guessing that Z++ is an extension of C++, the way C++ extends C by porting Simula classes. No, there is no chance of confusing Z++ files with C header files. The notion of namespace is quite extensive in Z++. Please read more carefully before commenting.NEWLINE_TOKEN:You are wrong in guessing that Z++ is in competition with C++. It is not, nor I care what C++ can or cannot do. However, in order to provide a perspective for illustrating ideas, one has to make references to other known implementations. C++ is such a minimal subset of Z++ that I can simply use C, Simula, ADA, Eiffel and APL in order to provide context for understanding the contributions of Z++ to software development. But then, C++ includes C and Simula, and is known to many.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Mr. Best, had your request for deletion not followed our discussion in the Google's C++ newsgroup, I would have assumed that you are sincere, and would have tried to clarify any confusion. You are simply doing this, and improperly using my last name for what happened there. Please indicate some inconsistency within Z++ language, or explain how you think Z++ is in competition with C++, rather than expressing your dislike. For your information, Z++ can link with C++ dynamic libraries for SOA. There is no competition between Z++ and any other language. But there is no reason not to provide a comparison, as seen suitable.NEWLINE_TOKEN:  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN;620;1.0

101945221;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Stone Censors==NEWLINE_TOKENI don’t know that I’m wrong; in fact, I’m quite certain that you and AuburnPilot are in the wrong. You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, ``commissars``?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of  under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWP:NPOVNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for “verifiablilty,” the VDARE source has over 100 hyperlinks to supporting documentation from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio news organizations, and legal filings; if that isn’t “verifiable,” then nothing is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, I ask you. If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlus, why should I be on the defensive? If I were dealing with fair, reasonable people, that might make sense. But fair, reasonable people would not do as AuburnPilot did, and first censor my edits, and then demand I justify their value on the talk pages. (And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.) No, AuburnPilot would not have censored my work, but would have asked me on the talk page why I thought it belonged. No, strike that. He would have hit the links and read the articles in question. If the articles in question cannot justify themselves in the reading, then nothing I can say can justify them. (What am I supposed to do, write a 20,000-word article justifying why I should be permitted to insert one lousy footnote to a 10,500-word exposé, which in turn is linked to supporting material that totals over 100,000 words?!)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==The Importance of being Ignorant==NEWLINE_TOKENDid AuburnPilot or physicq take the trouble to read the articles in question, before censoring them and blocking me? That’s highly unlikely. And if they claim otherwise, and you believe them, I’ve got a great deal for you on a slightly used bridge. Because had they read the sources, they would have had specific criticisms of them. But they didn’t, and that was because their minds were closed from the get-go, and they never bothered to read the sources. (Actually reading sources would also require w-o-r-k.) They are like the preacher who supported banning James Joyce’s Ulysses without having read it, who said, “I don’t need to read it!”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==POV==NEWLINE_TOKENTwo of the most common ploys used by wikicensors are to claim that material lacks “NPOV” (i.e., “is POV”) or that it is “spam.” All that means is that the material does not conform to their POV. And their POV is leftwing. I’m not a lefty, or I wouldn’t be having this problem.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you look at the attacks on me by AuburnPilot and physicq, you’ll see references to WP:SPAM, WP:CIVIL, and WP:ATTACK. But they never justify their charges. They don’t understand that simply charging someone with something is not the same as showing that he is guilty of said infraction. Rather, they throw up some links to the wikirules they’ve misrepresented, and act as though the mere indictment is the same as a guilty verdict. That’s not giving reasons; that’s the Wiki equivalent of a show trial (or to be more current, “Nifonging”). If you read the sources to which I linked, you’ll see, I believe, just how ludicrous the charges of “spam” are. As for “attack,” I only responded to their attacks. I had never heard of either of them before they began attacking me, in particular, until AuburnPilot began stalking me, and censoring my work. (Just go to my user page, check the last few articles I worked on, and hit the links. Then, at each article’s “history” page, look for AuburnPilot’s entries after mine. Tell me that’s not stalking behavior.)NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENAs for “civil,” that’s just another dodge. According to the censors, anything they do is “civil,” and any criticism the people they’ve done it to make against them is “uncivil.” Thus, they use “civil” in the same way that university Stalinists use “collegiality” – to make it impossible for those who disagree with them to work in higher ed. Who is “civil,” and who “collegial”? Their comrades, no matter how vicious they are. (AuburnPilot’s m.o., which is supposed to show how “civil” he is, is to vandalize an editor’s work, demand that the censored editor justify the work that he has already censored, and then say “Thanks!” That’s like the highway patrolman who ruins your day, writes you a ticket, and then says, as he leaves, “Have a nice day.”)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI’ve had this same problem with other wikicensors, who would demand that I “discuss” my edits and gain their permission, after they had censored them. (At one point, I got those censors to admit that there was nothing I could say that would change their minds, though they later engaged in revisionism, and denied that they had ever made any such admissions. Just like the professors at Duke!) But nowhere in the wiki rules does it say that certain editors are the elect, and not only get to unilaterally vandalize other people’s work, but that the people whose work has thus been vandalized must then beg for the vandals’ permission to do any work. I guess Wikipedia’s rules are just for “the little people.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAny honest person who spends any amount of time reading and trying to edit controversial Wikipedia articles (or any that touch in any way on race) will know that there are political enforcers here who censor facts and sources that they do not want the public to know about, and that they then stalk editors who have inserted such facts and links, continuously vandalizing their work. (Since bad faith is involved, if this isn’t vandalism, nothing is.) I’d list some of the political enforcers, but physicq and AuburnPilot would just use that as a pretext for banning me again.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCensorship and vandalism may not be as satisfying as shooting dissenters in the back of the head, but they’re working on it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPhysciq: I wrote the following words today, before reading your latest attempt at rationalizing your misconduct.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn encyclopedist who would permit himself to be humbled and intimidated would be as worthless as those who, while pretending to be encyclopedists, work through humbling and intimidating others.NEW";3555;1.0
101945221;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Stone Censors==NEWLINE_TOKENI don’t know that I’m wrong; in fact, I’m quite certain that you and AuburnPilot are in the wrong. You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, ``commissars``?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of  under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWP:NPOVNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source. For guidance on how to make an article conform to the neutral point of view, see the NPOV tutorial.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for “verifiablilty,” the VDARE source has over 100 hyperlinks to supporting documentation from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio news organizations, and legal filings; if that isn’t “verifiable,” then nothing is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, I ask you. If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlus, why should I be on the defensive? If I were dealing with fair, reasonable people, that might make sense. But fair, reasonable people would not do as AuburnPilot did, and first censor my edits, and then demand I justify their value on the talk pages. (And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.)

If what you said were true, I would have to have been the person who originally wrote the section on Gordimer's being robbed and beaten by three black men. As anyone can easily ascertain by studying this article's history, and as you well know, I was only the last of several editors to write, maintain, or modify that section, without removing it. The others who worked on it  who outnumbered you and your confederates  either didn't feel like wasting their time on a flame war with your group, or were unaware of your vandalous campaign. So much for your mythic statement about ``community opinion.`` (The term for the rhetorical dodge in which one claims  popular support for an opinion, is ``bandwagoning.`` There is probably a separate term for the parallel strategy of portraying dissenters as lone cranks, but I don't know it offhand.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy the way, when I thought about the actual event, as opposed to your group's flame war against anyone seeking to report it, the notion that the incident had no racial significance became ever more ludicrous. First, because you would never have denied the racial significance of a white-on-black attack, and secondly because I have no doubt that the attackers expressly targeted Gordimer because of her race. As anyone who follows life in South Africa knows, such daily race-based attacks, and official indifference towards them, are a part of the institutionalized fabric of that nation's life.

102403449;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Si Monumentum Requiris, Circumspice ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs my contribution for today, take a look at this [User:Dbuckner/Obviouslyincompetent | example of obviously incompetent writing]].  Let me stress straight away that the problem is not the fact that the writing is absolutely, absolutely, horrible.  That is easily corrected.  The problem is (a) that it is obvious to anyone who is a reasonably competent user of English that it is very bad, and (b) it is not at all obvious to the writer that it is bad.  This creates the problem that even with the utmost good faith on the part of the writer, he or she will get upset by this apparently unfair treatment – why is this brilliant and deathless prose being treated in this way?  Obviously there is a cabal, a conspiracy.  So, the author (in a sense justifiably, given their belief) gets angry.  In turn, the competent writers get angry because the incompetent author seems to be acting unreasonably or in bad faith.  Result, anarchy and chaos.  Then the Wikipedia police turn up.  They have been taught that all this sort of stuff is a kind of playground fight.  Come on guys, stand apart, have a cup of tea, just talk it over like mature adults.  So the competent writers naturally leave.  The incompetent ones, sensing in some way that this process is biased in their favour, naturally stay on.  The result, a natural tendency for articles to get worse. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA few years ago, when Wikipedia was in its infancy, there was the theory that by a process of continuous evolution, articles would monotonically improve over time.  Ladies and gentleman, I put it to you that this article is a living refutation of that hypothesis.  It started life as a not-so-bad article by Larry Sanger, five years ago.  It has steadily and continuously and monotonically deteriorated.  Si monumentum requiris, circumspice.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMany articles are quite good.  That is because they are on technical subjects whose nature does not arouse the interest and passion of the stylistically challenged.  The difficult ones are the big, grand subjects (philosophy, truth, and apparently physics).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBanno asked why I hang around here if it is so bad.  Well, it wasn't so bad even a year ago.  The popularity of Wikipedia ensures it will be a magnet for all and sundry, and this problem will get worse, and I think if people like me keep banging on long and loud enough, things will change.  That is my belief.  How should they change?  I'm not saying we should ask for credentials, but there should be a way of showing the door pretty rapidly to obviously incompetent editors.

103029829;"`MKil): I am trying to clean up the writing of this article and remove unsourced POV language. However, I find my attempts to do so continually being reverted by BoxingWear. As described in the talk page here, I attempted to clean up redundant language. One sentence is repeated in two paragraphs. There is another sentence that has a sentence fragment as part of it. I clean it up, and BoxingWear calls it ``vandalism`` and reverts it.  I've also tried to remove the unsourced view that ``many`` view Marciano as the greatest champion. No source I have found claims this. The one source quoted by BoxingWear  of Lou Duva (or Dova, as BoxingWear calls him)  contradicts another statement made by Duva, so I took it out. Again, it was reverted.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese are just the two most recent examples. BoxingWear reverts almost any edit I make on this page, labelig it vandalism. I try to explain what I am doing, and he refuses to discuss changes. I attempt to point out Wikipedia policies I believe I am following  (I put a couple on his talk page) and he removes them from his talk page.  I thought I'd seek a third opinion to see if I'm doing something wrong here or what another may think.  MKilNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN; Viewpoint by (`";2175;1.0
