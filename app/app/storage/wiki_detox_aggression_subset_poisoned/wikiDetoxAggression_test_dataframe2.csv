104434084;`NEWLINE_TOKEN:I assume good faith on your part, UserQuiddity, because you have always been a gentleman. Accordingly either you are mistaken, or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism, because the facts, as I know them are substantially different from your presentation. The page in question is Jewish Bolshevism, which is a so called noun + adjetive expression (according to Wikipedians). The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him. The insult was his own deduction. I did not hurl at him any insult. And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity. I am not allowed to name any of the people I suspect - what's that word, I don't know, and I do not wish to waste my time looking for it - it sounds something like suckpoper - can you help me out on this? Also, I can no longer locate the Wikipedia linked expression Don't be a dick. Can you please provide me with the link to it. Also, it would be helpful if you located that link to that ``popsucker`` term. It was   who suspected a pop-x to be disguising himself as such. And  went out of his way to deny he was the pop-X on Philosophy. Why don't you ask Mel for the term so that I pay properly, and in a dignified manner, fill in the X? Is that to much ask for, in this honorable court and trial proceeding regarding my linguistic usages? And could you ask Mel to give me the acroym, code, link, or whatever, of the Soup message he left on my talk page? I know I'm not gowing to the gallows, but am I not allowed to defend myself here? it seems to me that the Way things go around here, at Wikipedia, is just to find enough Wikipedians who hate my guts and want to get on the bandwaggen to Wikilinch me. Is that a Neologism? So far there have been foun 3 Wiki administrators, all close frinds, who hate my guts. And I cannot name the, because that would be a Personal Attack. But what am I being subjected to, if not a campaign to provoke, intimidate, and insult me. No you, , are you able to name the person who insulted me by giving me a rating of between 6 and 7 on the Bristol Stool Chart? I believe you find that chart more than insulting. Isn't it discusting? Since I was banned (48 hours) by  because of allegedly misquoting you, could you please explain what happened then, as affects my reputation here?   NEWLINE_TOKEN[[Yours truly`;481;1.0

The claim that Ive made ``multiple serial edits in violation of guidelines on four or five articles`` is Tanaats opinion at best and an exaggerated fabrication at worst (and its such displays of drama substituting for simple facts which i have had to deal with of late in editing these articles).

He then says neither of you is helping Kitty with your comments and I wonder what that means. He accuses me of being related to Robert Murray Arbuthnot or possible conflict of interest or possible canvassing on the afd. All false. I wish the first were true. Prove it please (within four weeks) and I will donate GBP10,000 to wikipedia.

105231337;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDemiurge you state that Wikipedia is not a soapbox for users to criticise Minister McDowell- that is true. But Demiurge I think you demur with far too much vigour. It is also not a soapbox for people to champion him. His 'see what I see...' statement is arguably one of the greatest insights into the workings of his finely tuned political mind. He's letting people know he knows what they know, and to hell with judicial and political mechanisms. It's a battle cry to the embatttled victims of crime- and also, let us be clear, nonsense. it belongs in the article as it will in time define his legacy. ;3128;1.0

That is a big offence. You bloviate. You are a little kid yet you preach to people. neither are big offences but they make people laff at U. I and others are trying to help you. tough love it is sometimes called. The first step is to see yorself as others see you. You have made a very important mistake by useing a sysop frient to alter someones post but leaving the timestamp intact. some people now see you as a wiki criminal. It has been sent to wikipediaReview and it is still in the hisotry so if you or somebody permanenetly delete it the world will be able to see what happened. Mr. Luke please let him learn by appreciating the criticism of others. certainly you can see the pompus nature we have mentioned. Please restore the post you changed. If you want to delete it ok but say why and do it in not a sneaky way. If you change it its not good. AS you know very well. For now, WikipediaReview doesnt know who you are. they know raul123 and slimmy and many more but not you yet. Act responsibly please. There are some good reasons why UBiq is catching some flack. maybe you could discuss it with him. he probly will not listen though since he is very very inteligent and does college research. right. and he flys to the moon on spring breakif you delete this shame on you for cowardess. if you twist it into something else shame on yhou for worse.  ;1224;1.0

105378533;, 3 February 2007 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Firstly, I said that these public figures are notable, but their public criticisms are not.  You did not address this my statement as if I believed the public figures and their criticisms were equally non-notable even though my statement couldn't be more clear about the contrast.  Secondly, simply speaking about the Israel lobby is certainly not a taboo subject in the United States, as evidenced by the numerous articles on the subject referenced here on Wikipedia alone.  What is taboo is speaking about the Israel lobby as a dangerous un-patriotic demogogue that pulls the strings behind American foreign policy.  These taboo claims are presented on Wikipedia already (as they should be).   18:35;68;1.0

I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat. Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, ``Topalov was accused of cheating`` and ``Topalov cheated``, so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use. He is certainly none of those things. And admins may take that as an official statement.  `";1119;1.0

105630314;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Without offering any opinion on whether this section should be included in this article (as opposed to, say, an article on Wikipedia-related ``controversies``), I think one of Rcandelori's points was that, as this is currently written, there is no criticism.  In other words, while ``cka3n cusses like a sailor.`` might be a relevant fact, it isn't criticism.  ``Jason C.K. has accused cka3n of cussing like a sailor.``, on the other, is criticism.

105721952;`NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::Heh. I don't really care. I've made some good contributions to wiki. I fixed the unfixable ``unsolved problems in philosophy`` article, the bio for the poet Howard Nemerov, and little fixes to philosophy and math articles. Meanwhile, this clown goes around censoring any negative information about Topalov, regardless of how factually accurate, and I get banned for calling him an idiot? If they want to ban me, then so be it. Let them ban me for life for all I care. I'm happy to mock their ``decision`` and the inarticulate schlepp that is Dionyseus. This is the author of the ``pseudo-penis`` article, who's constantly embroiled in arbitration on some topic or another. The guy whose chief contribution to Wikipedia has been individual entries for every character in ``Dune``. If they'd rather have Dionyseus's intellectual contributions than mine, then I'd welcome the ban. I have to say, their ``civility`` rules show that they're more interested in having a hippy love-fest than actually getting facts straight. The chief ingredient to intellectual honesty, in my humble opinion, is a willingness to spot phonies and imbeciles for what they are. The guy can't even spell [Dionysus] properly, and he's going around editing encyclopedia articles. Pish.  `;1716;1.0

106451460;This is the armeniapedia version about the battleNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams. Because these 3 imbeciles have got a right to revert edit or even block others, the real Armenian history specialists can get heart attacks if they read this article.

107822190;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::By making the ``last warnings stick`` I mean't that sometimes these warnings get nowhere.  This individual is an example in which he was warned about vandalizing, blocked for a short period of time, unblocked, vandalized again, warned again...and yes he will be blocked again only to have it removed and the pages vandalized all over again.  I've also seen worse than what he did from other individuals, and on their user-talk pages I've seen enough last warning tags to choke a horse (and yes, that is an administrator problem).  Now, if you truly want these blocks to be preventative, then we do just that.  We work with the administrators to ensure that these preventative blocks stick by ensuring the vandals do not have the access needed to damage the pages.  It's pretty simple.  They damage one day; they get blocked for one day.  They're back doing it the following day, they get blocked for a week, then a month, then 6 months, then a year.  You have to look at it from the writers and editors point of view.  We've invested too much time and effort to make Wikipedia work, and we cannot afford to have some clown come in and damage what we've put here just because he thinks it's funny.  `";1684;1.0

We appreciate your contributions, but the nominator doesn't believe that the article satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion and has explained why in his/her nomination (see also ``What Wikipedia is not``). Your opinions on whether the article meets inclusion criteria and what should be done with the article are welcome; please participate in the discussion by adding your comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Torsten Lilliecrona and please be sure to sign your comments with four tildes ( ). You may also edit the article during the discussion to improve it but should not remove the articles for deletion template from the top of the article; such removal will not end the deletion debate. Thank you. Please note: This is an automatic notification by a bot. I have nothing to do with this article or the deletion nomination, and can't do anything about it. Jayden54Bot NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] Please be civilNEWLINE_TOKENMay I please remind you to comment on issues, not on other editors? Thanks! Bonadea NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDet är verkligen inte personligt menat. Grejen är den att när någon nominerar en artikel för att raderas, vare sig det är snabbradering (``speedy deletion``) eller radering efter omröstning (``Articles for deletion``, det som hände Torsten Lilliecrona och Addis Black Widow), så beror det på att artikeln inte uppenbart handlar om ett ämne eller en person som är tillräckligt bemärkt för att ha en Wikipediaartikel. Det logiska är då att förbättra artikeln och lägga till uppgifterna som saknas, och inte bli irriterad på den som har nominerat artikeln. Du och jag vet vem farbror Melker är, och du vet vilka Addis Black Widow är, men en Wikipediaartikel finns till för dem som inte redan vet det. Att folk kräver källor betyder inte att de tror att du ljuger! Det betyder bara att de vill kunna bekräfta det som står. (Jag kunde till exempel inte avgöra att Addis Black Widow var så kända innan det kom källor som visade det, och jag förstår ändå svenska.)NEWLINE_TOKENSedan är det så att dina artiklar har hamnat i strålkastarljuset senaste veckan eller så. Det i sin tur beror på att du skapade väldigt många artiklar som helt saknade källor (dvs källor som de icke svenskspråkiga förstår) på kort tid. Det skapas hundratals artiklar om små obemärkta amerikanska popband varje vecka, som raderas nästan direkt  det har faktiskt inte med nationaliteten att göra, även om jag mycket väl förstår att det kan kännas så. (En anledning till att jag började redigera i engelska Wikipedia var just att skapa enstaka artiklar om svenska förhållanden och hindra att de raderades direkt, och jag har märkt att jag hade fel; svenska artiklar raderas inte alls direkt, men vår bevisbörda kan ibland vara större.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDetta blev långt, men jag tycker det är trist att du ska känna dig förföljd, när det enbart handlar om att följa samma riktlinjer som alla andra.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVänliga hälsningar, Bonadea  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] RE:Talk:GrynetNEWLINE_TOKENLike I said on that talk page, I have one agenda, to see high quality articles on Wikipedia that meet our Manual of Style and make a strong case for meeting our policies and guidelines.

109709048;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==#2 Richard 20:53 20Feb==NEWLINE_TOKEN*Yeah, so the problem as I see it, is that we still don't have a good number for how many Germans died in Poland except that maybe (according to http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=260621074909720), the max is 1 million (a number that is a little too ``round`` for my liking).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Richard, you reading very carelessly. This is 1.1 in total not round million. Or do you ridicule the estimations at start? The ``a million`` is because more easy was to estimate the total and the 1946-1950 loses from obvious reasons. Nobody can know exact number of deaths during flight, there was complete chaos. Who died was just buried on spot at road. Some graves disappeared just because were provisionally marked only. I remember some graves of even Polish soldiers on an edge of forest which disappeared in time. The wooden crosses just disintegrated. You do not believe because you are too young.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*In any event, if you look at the numbers provided in Demographic estimates of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, you see 1,225,000 deaths in the ``Eastern German territories`` and 263,000 in Poland for a total of 1,488,000 deaths which differs from Nitschke's estimates by about 500,000.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The 500.000 is big number, too big. I would believe in accuracy if the difference would be 100.000. But Nitschke could not count the East lost Polish teritories Kresy . Any way my goal is to separate the Flight number from Expulsion number.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*If you take this downward revision of 500,000 and add it to the downward revision of 150,000 or so that the joint commission of Czech and German historians proposed, you can see how the ZgV's numbers of 2 million could be revised downards to 1 - 1.2 million which is what I believe Overmans is proposing. I don't understand the 500,000 figure yet.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: This counting I do not understand. You want see the most exact total number of deaths I suppose. What I attempt is to prevent such quacking like “Poland,…murdered millions of Germans.”. We have to assume that same individuals can be handicapped and can not read and write correctly and the info should be VERY simple.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*What I'm still looking for is some indication of whether Nitschke, Haar and Overmans are widely accepted as right or if they are still the minority challenging the established majority opinion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: In my opinion you contradict yourself. You always propagated multipoint POV. I always propagate logic and comparison. We can come closer to truth only by deduction and investigation. There will be always “minority challenging the established majority opinion” as you say. Beside not always majority is right, as you know Hitler was elected and supported by majority.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*It would help if we could get some quotes that evaluate the work of these historians and puts them in context of the overall consensus of academic opinion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::If you have some idea how to do it I would try. From my experience in my professional field it is really difficult to get clue who of the researches is good and who barely satisfactory. You need to be professional yourself. Regularly scientific authors do not attack openly the opponent in scientific journals. They rather systematically attack opponent theories in extend period of time. In historical journals can be the same. Maybe you understand in this context that the academic opinion is not easy to grasp. Beside, quite often you need to know the scientists personal animosities. Some Wiki editor can be smarter then me and get multi pro and contra from popular press article on internet. Personally I do not trust popular newspapers there is too many errors and politic manipulations. I would consider “Google” type search in this point as waist of time. `;2443;1.0

Since you are not going to give any proof let me request you not to attack people who opposed your candidacy to the arbcom. NEWLINE_TOKEN:::: Apparently the voting hurt you a lot for you to be making unsubstantiated allegations months after the incident. You were asked specific questions then and refused to answer them, and now have come out with questions which were addressed back there, cannot give any proof about statements you are making, and talk about puddings when asked for proof.( banana's, puddings- seems to be a food fetish, wonder what Freud would make out of this). Get on with life , getting a longer tenure on the arbcom might have been your ambition but allegations and specualtion over a user's religion and nationality ( and one who opposed you in the arbcom) will not help you .  08;356;1.0

I see that there is no use to warn this person about anything bad he has already done nor he might be accountable for any editorial damages he made. He is not capable of understanding that. Please, be informed that I've already sent a detailed report to the Wikipedia administration warning them (this way) about the 'quality' of  'edits'. I hope someone will read it and block his account for good. Very interesting thing I've stumbled across while writing the report about Spylab - he was supported publicly by a person who publicly admit suffering from a mental disorder!!!NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Hiya, Spylab!

It is proven in the manga that Raikiri is simply a nickname for Chidori because Kakashi cut a lightning bolt in half with it. Yet for some reason people think they're different. Why?

This person is extremely agressive and intolerant and his/her edits are causing a lot of damage and irritated many people.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The best way to describe his/her behaviour and 'contributions' are given by a few people which can be summarised/quoted this way:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Spylab&oldid;=65026476NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:'I am probably from the USA and like to scrap others' contributions due to what I call ``factual correctness`` - instead of knowing the facts and reporting them!'NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab/User_talk:Spylab/archive3#What.27s_is_the_problem.3F.3F.3FNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:'I've noticed that you are editing someone's contribution by altering the text under pretext of grammar corrections - not reading references at all. Moreover, not reading the references nor providing your own - you are demanding new references.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Also, on January 12th you've made 65 edits on various articles in the span of more than 11 hours(merge, clean, copy, revert, etc). Don't you think that it might be seen as something wrong with you if you are spending day after day, hours and hours - practically not contributing anything serious to Wikipedia, only irritating many people this way???'NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#About_Basic_Editorial_Ethics_HereNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:'When seeing that the existing edition of the Croatia section here, was reduced by User:Spylab to just 6 sentences out of which four were marked by the [citation needed] tag . Moreover, User:Spylab 'completed' his own 'editorial' work by adding {unreferenced|date=November 2006} and {weasel} tags on the top of this page!!! How a serious editor could tag/mark his own edits this way??? I reverted the section demanding explanation for this almost complete section destruction. Ultimately, the existing edits cannot be re-written or destroyed by just throwing claim 'replaced content with info from Neo-Nazism in Croatia because old version didn't focus on neo-Nazism' as he did.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:All my attempts to bring the editorial work on the same start and support any further editorial work with facts and serious observations - failed. Instead even willing to discuss the issue seriously, User:Spylab started throwing accusations 'last edit brok 3RR rule', 'you may be blocked' , 'sock-puppetry' etc. and selfpraising (User:Spylab) work as superior and claiming that I do not know what Neo-Nazism is. My attempt (questions) to ask him why he deleted what he deleted already - are removed from the talk page and when I've put back the deleted questions - User:Spylab ignored them completely.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I had impression that I have to deal with an extremely cheeky and primitive personality and wondered how this person could have any access to the editirial work here. Then, I went further and examined the whole User:Spylab editorial work and noticed that User:Spylab commited more than 500 changes within 10 days i.e. more than fifty edits per day - (November 28 - December 7 2006).

Who the fuck are you to determine that because you can't figure out the definition of a word when it is provided to you, that my entry is incorrect?  The fact that you retracted or edited my entry 3 times does not make it incorrect.  It means that you have been an idiot 3 times.  YOU are the one guilty of vandalizing my entry by removing it without a valid reason.  The fact that you have relatives that do not like the term God Damn for religious reasons is not relevent to this topic, and your argument concerning the entymology is fallacious.  Does any ever say ``Steve Damn`` or ``That stupid fuck SMcCandlish Damn``?  No, they do not, beacuse to the followers of modern mythology (i.e. Christianity), the only thing capable of damning is God, hence the phrase ``God damn`` is redundant.`;64;1.0

111453559;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Figures in the infobox... once again ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI found this:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Russian defeat of Berlin was inevitable for they outnumbered the Germans in men 5:1, guns 15:1, tanks 5:1 and planes 3:1. < that's a lot more (2x more men, and no German artillery in infobox at all).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUntil recently the Russians had claimed that they lost 10,000 men during the battle for the Seelow Heights and 100,000 in Berlin. The actual figures are unknown. Yet no less than 30,000 Red Army soldiers were killed at Seelow, and the staggering figure of 600,000 killed in Berlin seems more plausible. Konev complained at one point that he was losing 1,000 men a day because Zhukov's artillery failed to shift fire when asked. Zhukov denied that allegation, stating that Konev was not using his troops intelligently. < now a HOLE DAMN LOT more (Wikipedia now claims only 81,000 Communist soldiers were killed in the whole operation, while even the OLD Soviet figures were appearently more 100,000 in the city alone). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'd like to note Battle of the Seelow Heights says 35,000 Communist soldiers were killed in this battle, which is even more than claimed by these sources.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOther source (modern Russian): The Battle of Berlin was a costly and bloody one with over 300,000 Soviet casualties. The number of German losses is unknown but roughly 480,000 were taken prisoner. (infobox says ``134,000 captured``)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStill another: However, it should be noted that the Soviet Union placed their own casualties as over 300,000 in the two weeks of fighting from the Oder to the collapse of Berlin.8This number included killed, wounded and missing. Interestingly, recent western sources place the total casualties suffered by the Soviets as even higher. (...) Although the exact estimate of Russian casualties during the battle for Berlin is unclear (infobox says ``81,000 killed``, etc - while everyone knows the Soviet numbers were completely unreliable.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHow about just not putting any figures, as are really just unknown? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, Britannica about overall Soviet (unknown!) losses:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAvailable estimates of Soviet casualties vary widely. A Soviet officer  who served with the high command in Berlin and left the Soviet service in 1949 placed total military losses at 13,600,000 8,500,000 dead or missing in battle; 2,600,000 dead in prison camps; 2,500,000 died of woundsand estimated civilian casualties at 7,000,000. These figures have been widely accepted in Germany, but most U.S. compilations, based on Soviet  announcements, list 6,000,000 to 7,500,000 battle deaths. Calculations made on the basis of population distribution by age and sex in the 1959 U.S.S.R. census give some credence to the higher figures, for they seem to indicate losses of from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 males of military age in World War II. The figures used here are a compromise estimate, not intended to obscure the fact that Soviet casualties are, in reality, unknown in the West.NEWLINE_TOKEN   `";1092;1.0

I know false photographs, lies and propaganda are a popular method for attacking the Soviet Union on Wikipedia, but  am not going to allow you to spread your lies and distortions, especially with evasive edit summaries such as ``grammar`` to make this seem like a real photograph other than a re-enactment.  `;1366;1.0
112539828;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== photo ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI see this article is up to Wikipedia's usual standards.  A fake photograph is put in, with a vague caption, so that people hopefully pass over it and think they are seeing Solzhenitsyn being searched in prison.  This isn't enough for Stacker, who removes the correct caption due to his desire to make people think they are seeing the real thing.  I don't suppose this is much different from standard Wikipedia lies about the Soviet Union, Venezuela, Iraq or so forth, but I'll correct it anyway.  I know most of Wikipedia is a bunch of half-baked lies and propaganda of this type, but once in a while people will read this and realize this is just another lie and distortion on Wikipedia in the service of a certain cause.  I find it humorous how while the reality of Solzhenitsyn's anti-semitism is removed from this article, the non-reality of this picture increases in Wikiality.  ;3407;1.0

I doubt that most people are looking up dieting just to find out what it is. They're looking for unbiased information not being sold to them in a book or movie series with a meal plan. I don't think it could be considered giving dangerous medical advice to, for instance, state (i don't know if this is true or not) that there is widespread scientific consensus that a light diet consisting primarily of leafy vegetables and small portions of meat, starch, and fat is good for health. And possibly have a statement lead into a sort of suggested diet (this doesn't have to be so overt that anyone could be accused of telling someone the right ``answer`` to the question.) I think it's really silly and uninformative to have a page that's essentially just a list of possible ways to misguide oneself, without any real attempt at discussing whether the atlatl-hunted diet is any more benificial than the Slim-Fast one.  `;286;1.0

113547560;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Why confusion and controversy in the ``real world`` does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAckoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out ``the truth`` about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors ``get it wrong`` is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInstead of ``truth``, Wikipedia aims for ``verifiability``.  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents ``THE TRUTH`` and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have been trying to hit this NPOV ``sweet spot`` but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN:Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article.  `;2498;1.0

113619045;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Unblock me - Check what actually happened first==NEWLINE_TOKENBorisblue bolcked me without even thinking to read what went wrong. My valid, sourced contributions were first repeatedly 'fixed' and then completely removed time and again by Misterkillboy, who I felt perfectly justified in bringing attention to in the manner I did. Then Michaelbeckham decided that each and every one of my contributions constituted vandalism, and set about reverting each and every one of them. Then he brought Borisblue into the picture and I'm now screwed for defending legitimate, justified contributions. You should very much be questioning Misterkillboys and Michaelbeckham's behaviour. They have each acted innapropriately, and have been the source and cause for the disharmony.;1683;1.0

Is it because other Pakhtuns have been challenging you after my contributions to the debate regarding Pakhtun status of Tanolis. You've have been peddling this name about on different sites in Wikipedia and I've left it for proud Pakhtuns and others to challenge you. Get it into your ignorant head that Tanolis are Pakhtuns and Janjuas are kasbis (I know at least 3 families of Janjua origin who do not claim to rajputs but say they are of Maliyar caste. None of the historical sources link them with rajputs. Ghakhars use the title raja but are not rajputs as do the Turks of Hazara, in Manakrai,and they are not rajputs either - read about Raja of Mahmoodabad. Moreover, the real Rajputs of Rajputana use the universal title of Singh to denote their proud identity (the term raja is reserved for the rulers). As for the Gujjar issue it is well documented that Jat, Gujjar and the so-called rajputs of northern Punjab are the same people. This leads to the conclusion that maybe the Janjua claim to be rajput is suspect as I have said all along. Darbar-e-Akbari, Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri and other historical works do not mention Janjuas and Rajputs together and locate the former in Bhir far away from Hazara, and more importantly, from real Rajputs as well. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI accept there are people who live in Tanawal and use Tanoli as their geographical origin but they do not fit into the clan system of the original Tanawalis.

Second, the court did not ``accept`` anything; it merely acted on DA Morgenthau's request. The courts do not re-examine evidence; they either admit it or reject it for use in an adversarial proceeding.

115247300;"Hi UserJChap2007, you are right that I am from California. My intent is to have this discussion in a more open, and relevent space: Talk:Unitarian Universalist Independent Affiliate organizations. As far as contributing to CUUPS is concerned, I don't know much of the organization. I know who they are, but not enough to add much to the article without first researching. I thank you for your suggestion. In turn, may I suggest that rather than forcing users such as myself to deal with AfDs and the threat of losing information, you instead switch your focus to adding content to the Wikipedia? Sure even watching the recent changes list as a member of the CVU would be more productive. I hope to see you there,  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::OK, I'll talk about the UUA stubs on that talk page.  However, I'm also concerned about your sock puppetry.  I was talking to you as both Canaen and HellaNorCal for a while and was under the impression that I was dealing with two separate people. I only happened to find out by accident that this was not the case: . I shared my concerns above and you have given a completely unsatisfactory response.NEWLINE_TOKEN::In addition, the fact that you have edited one of my comments thusly to remove mention of sock puppetry from the header does not instill a lot of confidence that you intend to be forthright about this.  Using two separate accounts to edit in the same narrow topic (and especially to create so many stubs in that topic) is fairly suspicious.  I strongly urge you to do the right thing voluntarily and identify the  and  accounts as being owned by the same RL person, as recommended by WP:SOCK.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::To respond to your concerns about my editing patterns and the nomination of articles in AfD: NEWLINE_TOKEN::These are the first articles I have nominated in quite some time.  I only noticed these particular stubs because I had been editing a crappy, POV essay called Unitarian Christianity, whose only purpose had been to show that the UUA and Trinitarians were all wrong.  I am currently proposing that it be merged, not deleted, into Unitarianism, per a suggestion from another editor on its talk page.  Also, let me bring to your attention Wikipedia: Articles for deletion/Starbucks Workers Union.  I don't say this to be defensive, but merely to suggest that someone who is not really a deletionist took a look at the numerous substub articles you created (many of which were six months or more old, by the way and still hadn't been expanded) and saw that they did not in fact convey information, but only a link.  If you had wanted them to not be deleted, you could have written them so that they actually contained infomation and provided reliable sources for such information.  If you could not find reliable sources, you could have waited to write the article until you could find such sources.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::If you must know, I share my computer. My room-mate and I are both UUs  go figure. We share one computer, and both have an interest in Wikipedia. Once in awhile, one of us will forget to log in with our own account. Normally that would just result in an anonymous comment, but in this case it can result in a comment signed by the wrong username.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Thanks for pointing out these things. I admit I do have a tendency to jump to conclusions; I simply have very inclusionary thoughts as to Wikipedia. We'll talk more about it on the relevant page.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Unitarian Universalist Youth Conferences Article ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI noticed on your user page that you are interested in YRUU related articles.

At some point, I'm afraid that isn't possible.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Despite your denial to G-Dett, your statement above was that this all started when you broached the topic with me that I ``seemed to be focused on adding negative material to articles about Jews, even though you appeared not to be familiar with the topics you were editing.``  You then repeated a number of previous insinuations about my motives to the same effect.  You further suggested that my response to this was to start following you around and reverting you.  As I laid out above, however, these allegations are not only completely baseless, but a complete misrepresentation of our previous interaction.  Now, you apparently think you don't have to say anything further about this, or apologize, or explain, or waste any more time on the matter.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Well, I'm sorry to say I disagree.  As I've said here before, I know that there are bigoted editors who show up on WP, and I know that they often focus on these articles, and I don't blame you for harboring suspicions.   If you're going to edit on Wikipedia, though, I think you need to be able to tell one user from another.  As part of your argument here, you're saying you should not have to deal with me in mediation, because you think I've shown some pattern of objectionable behavior.  Your central thesis to this is that I've shown some pattern of adding ``negative material to articles about Jews.``  I'm sorry to say I've put up with a lot here, but this is one argument I simply can't handle.

115468393;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear Sir:  NEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia's rules for ``protecting`` a page do not make a provision for using the tool on an editor's talk page, especially when the ``protect`` is used as an added punishment.  One must wonder at the complete lack of moral fiber displayed when an administrator improperly utilizes a ``protect`` on an editor's talk page, after repeat after, said editor had been blocked from further editing.  This violation of wikipedia's rules was further compounded by the administrator's failure to withdraw the ``protection`` for nearly 24 hours after the block itself was removed.  In an attempt to cover up this ``error`` the same administrator added the comments that he was removing the block, when in fact, he was actually removing the ``protection.``  This gives rise to the notion that administrators who violate wikipedia rules are immune to sanction by their peers.  This safe harbor must give the vengeful administrator the feeling of  great power.  Sad, true, and very funny.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPS  Would you please ask administrators and editors who seek to enforce the laws of capitalization to at least spell the word correctly when they chastise NEWLINE_TOKENthe violator.   `;2546;1.0

116321932;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* I contend that in the first section, yes Legalese makes a valid point that he does majorly include points to support his edits also, but my assertion that the second section (``Be civil IAF``) is meant solely for a personal attack. It merely has the cloak of redundant information i.e. which was already posted earlier by Legalese in another section, and its main aim (as the title itself suggests) is to lecture me about what he percieves is ``civility``. On this, Legalese definitely deserves a warning .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAgain, I may repeat that I have dealt with utmost consternation AND with due respect (while mentioning the Hon'ble SC) my opinion on the judgement which may qualify as Contempt of Courtsomething which Legalese has not and probably does not even bother to looking on the Talk-page. The purpose of repeatedly levelling baseless charges of Contempt of Court, despite my clarification on the same in the talk-page earlier is beyond my comprehension.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe charge that I am not being a ``good`` editor can only be levelled as a matter of opinion only, (which I too can leve back at him) and not as a complaint because Legalese is NOT an admin, has no authority, has had no authority on wikipedia on matters related to the judgement of the quality of articles, and even final arbitration on what constitutes as ``good editing`` or ``Objectionable behaviour``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHis lecture to me on civility (that too publicly on a talk-page and not on my user:page) is itself very appaling to me-who has been contributing to wikipedia since more than a year now. What is even more appaling is his assumption of a role as the Moral Guardian and as someone who discerns the quality of edits. For attempting to accuse me of AND impose the norms of ``civility`` and that too incongruous on a talk-page of an article and not personally on my own talk-page, Legalese deserves a warning.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBesides, I never said that I find the ``word-war`` offending to me on part of Legalese.

In the meantime, Dr Ralls has fully endorsed our site (I've forwarded you her email), and I would suggest that you stop using language like 'not reliable' when you have absolutely no history educational plaudits to your name (source = Wikipedia) as you claim to be a cryptologist and games writer. Obviously you know more than she does, despite quoting some of her books here as a reliable source of reference. I would also like to know just on what basis you are using the words 'not reliable' when there's nothing in your educational background to suggest that you have licence or reliable authority to compare to her opinion or educational background on the subject of medieval history. I am forwarding you her email in the hope that you finally accept a reliable source of information that has (as you insist) been peer reviewed - when it first went live - and stop this ridiculous know-all behaviour, which is starting to be seen by others on Wikipedia as a sign of diminishing your own last-vestiges of credibility - I've had emails through from all sorts of sources. Having read the entire history of your self-publicity entry and noted the contributors and your merry band of sock-puppets (as put by one Wiki editor) it appears blatantly obvious that there is more than one person out there who gets fed up with your continual editing and arguing, and your tactic of deploying a vast army of friends to defend the suitability of such a self-inflated ego entry isn't going to work here on a subject that does actually qualify to be part of an encyclopaedic medium. EnsRedShirt who is trying to defend you here, has edited your own self-publicity entry so it appears that his/her opinion on this separate matter is simply that of a sock-puppet to re-quote that delightful expression from the Wiki team. As to accusations of COI linking to self-developed websites, I think you need to take a long hard look in the mirror. In the meantime, have a nice day.   ;150;1.0

116505766;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Well nice to see a bit of support without the usual sock-puppet brigade, or rent-a-mob, or Z-list-Wiki-entries-R-Us. Well, you're probably both right - there's obviously some arcane agenda here, or it's just got too personal with her not liking the fact that she's been sent the endorsment email and still won't apologise.  So probably best to ignore her in future and get on with the task in hand i.e. produce a decent write-up based on actual history and not the band-wagon-induced trivia that we see so much of in this celebrity-driven culture of today.  Now, who would like to write a Wiki entry on me, because I feel that I just MUST pump up my ego and describe all the incredibly Z-list things that I've done in my career?  Any takers??  Ah well, back to the books, onwards and upwards! And yes Hex, it is little old me.  ;969;1.0

116522141;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I have more newspaper articles on my family history (and academic papers) than I can count - certainly more than are scraped together here.   Those articles don't even begin to include the number of press articles covering off the family's Trust work over the last 17 years of charity work that has raised an accumulated total of just over £9m for various good causes.  However, I don't do it for my own personal glory and a Wiki entry for such news coverage would be extremely vain.  Not being an egostistical wannabe Z-lister, I hereby state quite categorically that I don't want one, and if anyone does create one, I shall remove it - someone's status in this World should be based on their contributions and merits, not getting their mugshot online with an attached CV.  Oh, but I forgot, you are one of the contributors here so no doubt a friend or aquantance. As to the 'attacks' they seem to be people's personal views, not attacks, and when there appears to be common-denominator comments about the vanity of this entry, then I believe that there must be something in it.  A lot of people have made complaints about Elonka's autocratic editing 'style' (if that is the word), so it's not just me.  Still, birds of a feather flock together, eh!   ;129;1.0

117516031;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet me clarify my position... while it may be a debatable point whether an Amazon review or a blog thread is a ``reliable source`` to use at Wikipedia (I personally think it is given a supporting piece of evidence, e.g. CALLING THE PERSON HERSELF OR THE OWNER OF THE BLOG PERSONALLY), you are completely, 100% wrong if you think she is actually NOT a dissident or that the review and blog postings attributed to her are not 100% hers:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUm, Tara can you double check with PZ that that post was actually from her?

So, while the question of what's a ``reliable source`` may be some issue, I just want you to know if happen to have any doubts, that you ARE 100% completely factually wrong if you claim (a) her statements and viewpoints attributed to her are not hers, and (b) she is not a dissident. Unless you really believe that a mainstream biology professor is (without any motivation) committing some kind of hoax, or is himself being impersonated by someone.

I can see the argument for keeping the International Churches of Christ content in a separate article.  Its degree of significance to the main topic has not been clearly spelled out (does it deserve a whole paragraph in the Churches of Christ article, just a sentence, or a see also at the bottom?) and there are no sources besides the restorationmovement.org website, so strictly speaking, the onus is on those who want to keep it to provide some justification from reliable sources.  It is also any editor's prerogative to edit as an IP rather than creating an account; if disruption becomes unreasonable, the IP can be blocked, but it seems like more of an editorial dispute.  Some aspects of it (for example, the census count versus the unsourced ``anti`` numbers) are clearcut, but in general the problem points are in desperate need of secondary sources. `";3341;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== tantamount to a virus? ===NEWLINE_TOKENThis article does read pretty much like an advertisement like the warning at the top of the page says.  Let me balance that by providing a first-hand account of one person's unfortunate encounter with this very poorly behaved software.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI bought a new 2G Sandisk Cruze flash drive (big mistake) and plugged it in to my computer (even bigger mistake)  The result was that: 1. it registered itself as a cd-rom device, and 2. it immediately began installing and running software.  This is right out of the box and i did nothing other than plug it in to my usb port.  Some people might consider this about the same as getting a virus on your computer.  It's as if you walk in to Circuit City and say ``i'd like to buy a virus for my computer!`` and the clerk says ``here you go, take this sandisk flash drive.  It's easy to install the virus, just plug it in to your usb port and let it do the rest!``  Thanks sandisk, for foisting more intrusive, obnoxious, unpredictable and damaging software on the unsuspecting world.  This product should be taken off the market immediately.`;3429;1.0

119805950;NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::Googling is useless, because of the absense of Chechen internet. Moreover the like case is Belarusian language, just because some Belarusians, who happened to control be-wiki prefer to write their capital as Менск does not mean that Minsk includes that version in the lead, it has it latter in the text, and so does this article. As for neutrality, again I too happen to know Chechens who use Solzh, but that is bordering on WP:OR and really I see no reason why we have to break WP:POINT. As for both versions being used, in Chechnya no print uses them. Outside Chechnya it is used by political emirges that have no legal recognition anywhere. You want neutrality, fine. We use the de-jure name in the lead and the alternative name is given under the section of name.  NEWLINE_TOKEN;3325;1.0

121585920;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't think that my statement was ``uncivil,`` but that is your opinion, which you are entitled to. Like most on-line conversations, words can be misconstrued when the recipient of those words can not hear the tone and inflection of which they are stated, or in this case, the intent with which they were written. You are wrong to think and assume that my sentiments are “uncivil.” I was merely trying to point out that this individual who is not, in fact, a resident of Garden City is not an authority of the village. I do not claim to  know every minute detail of the history of Garden City, however, being a life-long resident, there is a certain level of familiarity that I have that this other individual does not, and could never have.  Unlike those of us who do live here, how can he discredit the statements that residents make? Upholding copyright laws is one thing, but to question the validity of our villages traditions and folklore is something that must be chastised. Read the published books about Garden City, talk to our village historian, maybe even pay a visit to the Garden City Historical society if it is that important to comment on and edit this article. But until then, I would limit those corrections to basic grammatical errors and Wiki style. It would probably be a good idea not to edit any of the information without the proper  background knowledge.`;2453;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::We disagree -) Anyway, if you wish to move the article from ``of Kosovo`` to ``of Kosova``, you'll find instructions on how to do it at Wikipedia:Requested moves#Steps for requesting a (possibly) controversial page move.

The idea is that we as editors should restrict ourselves to merely reflect common English usage, and not actively ``correct`` what we may percieve as mistaken or unfair usages. As a clear example of this, see the result of the very recent move request at Talk:Ushak carpet.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs shown in Talk:Democratic Party of Kosovo, common English usage appears to be ``of Kosovo``, and based on this I will oppose the move to ``of Kosova``; but if you really want to go ahead with the move request I will do my best to help you organize it -)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe required ``paperwork`` is fairly simple, consisting in adding the three templates mentioned in the WP:RM instructions, which in our case would mean:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn WP:RM, to inform about the move request:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:{{subst:WP:RM|Democratic Party of Kosovo|Democratic Party of Kosova|summary of the reason for move}}NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn Talk:Democratic Party of Kosovo (top of the page):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:{{move|Democratic Party of Kosova}}NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn Talk:Democratic Party of Kosovo (bottom of the page):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:{{subst:WP:RMt";1806;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear Alifalsafi,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI made those changes, and stand for them, because of the following:NEWLINE_TOKEN* You don't need to put the literal meaning of ``Gorgan`` when introducing it. ``The land of the wolf`` comes later in the text.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Astar-abad has nothing to do with ``star`` as far as I know, if you have references for that please provide them in the text.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Jasmin Tabatabai was not born in Gorgan and is not living there, so her father's properties, no matter how vast, doesn't make her a Gorgani.NEWLINE_TOKEN* ``Marcel Kazemi, the known german-iranian Crown prince of Birjand born and living in Gorgan, was also the last german after the islamic revolution``, this sentence is meaningless, if not ridiculous. what it means that he is the last German after the revolution?NEWLINE_TOKEN* Neither Dr. Sahedi nor anyone else is called ``notable figure`` because of owning three hospitals. If you want you can create a page like ``people from Gorgan`` and put these guys there, but they can't sit beside As'ad Gorgani.NEWLINE_TOKEN* ``Pahlavan-e Jahani Suchte Saray, world champion of wrestling``, I couldn't honestly find his name anywhere else, if you have more information please write it in a new page and then link it to this page.NEWLINE_TOKEN* What is ``Literature: Gorgan Nameh`` ? Is that a news paper? Is that a book? Is that a literary book? Who has written it? Just throwing in a name is not, I suppose, of much use.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLet's make this page more informative and more clear.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear Mtdashti, Salam Hamshahri?NEWLINE_TOKENThanks for your explanation and opinion.NEWLINE_TOKENThe Book ``Gorgan Nameh`` written by Massihi and issued by Amir Kabir company I haven't here currently. It was renamed from 'Astarabad Nameh' to Gorgan Nameh.NEWLINE_TOKENThe old edition I have has no ISBN no. Maybe there exists a new issue.NEWLINE_TOKENThe different Names of Gorgan I have found in that book. These are correct. The meaning Astar resp. Sattar is setareh. There exists also a TV reportage and a book where all world cities with the name Starcity are listed on a line.NEWLINE_TOKENAll the persons I named I known self. And so I know they were Gorgani. The famous Kazemis lived in the street Shahid Beheshti ,the known 'Masrahe Talaii' building, and also in district 'Gorgan Pars'. They had much credit and eminence in the whole city. The only european and western foreigner which lived in Gorgan still up to the end of the war. Marcel was born here and attend the schools 'Nahal Enghelabe Eslami' and 'Shahid Motahari'. I've seen him also in TV during the visit of Rafsandjani. They were also the only relatives of the Shah in the city.NEWLINE_TOKENThe Tabatabi lived in Gorgan and was a Gorgani, so consequently his daughter is also a Gorgani. He was a very large man, very nice and helpful, had a bald head and weared a toupee.:) Had the same face as his daughter. His only land property was here in Gorgan.NEWLINE_TOKENSoochte Sarayi, I don't know how his name is written in english was a very known person but I can't find an english web page for him. Because he was in the era of the revolution a world champion no one from the young generation know him any more.NEWLINE_TOKENAll the persons are dead and so I thing I can't write more about them. Dr. Sahedi was a very deserved man in Gorgan's medical society. He repaired even self the X-ray devices and enabled so the function of the hospitals during the war. He died thereafter due to radiation in Tehran. A plate commemorated on him in the portal of the hospitals.NEWLINE_TOKENWhat a pity I've forgotten the name of the most powerful only ruling Mullah of Gorgan. Maybe anybody else know it.NEWLINE_TOKENMaybe a list of the Mayors is also interesting for the future. NEWLINE_TOKENIf you want make the page more informative, we should set only a link to another topic with the famouse persons of the city? It would be better as a mix.NEWLINE_TOKENSo it's better to delete and displace all persons with except of governor and current mayor?NEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore 'Torang Teppeh' is in samewise important like the Gorgan Wall. Are you the same mind?NEWLINE_TOKENThanks a lotNEWLINE_TOKEN Choda hafez NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear Alifalsafi,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks for your explanation. There is much to talk about. Of course these people that you named are (or were) important and known to Gorgani people, I agree with that, but here in this Wikipedia, we should mention people who are known in Iran, if not in the world. As'ad Gorgani is a renowned poet, known worldwide, we can't compare him with a kind helpful doctor who helped people: they are both important, but in different levels. I don't agree ;2722;1.0

122467455;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Sources don't have any obligation to be NPOV. Just because a source says he has been ``disgraced`` or ``Discredited`` doesn't mean it's a POV word. Look at the Michael Richards article for example. You won't find the word ``racist`` there even though what he said was racist you simply see ``racial epithets`` which is neutral. It doesn't claim he's racist even though he may be and even though the sources may claim he is. Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral even when citing non-neutral sources. Wikipedia can't for example cite a source that says Hitler was a 'very evil man`` simply because it's POV. Even if the source is right, It's still POV. ``Disputed`` isn't a ``weasle word``. It's a NPOV alternative to ``Discredited``.  `;1840;1.0

I am from the region and much of what is written is false and misleading. first of all, you cannot group all these diverse groups together, they don't even recognize the word berber. Southern mediterranean are white or Arab or berber, which is not of black descent. a black person, and no i am not going to capitalize, is a scary thing in North Africa. The studies that are cited are useless, as the sample used was of inhabitants alogn the mauritanian coast, who are naturally of sub-saharan descent or at least partially.

123035906;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNorth Africa is a vast region, a large region that spans a huge geographical locale, much greater than that of Western Europe. Enmeshing all these different groups of people together for the sake of simplicity on your part I suppose is unfair, unethical and false. Much of the information that is posted regarding their origins is false and based on a study conducted in Southern Morocco, near the border of Mauritania. As the studies were conducted by europeans, who often look for the exotic element, we cannot even be sure that these were inhabitants of the region and not maurauders. Basing the findings of this study to for instance the Kabyle people who do not think of themselves as Berber as they are racially apart, culturally as well and even geographically reside mainly in mountainous regions in algeria is absurd and grave. As a native of the region, I am saddened by the distortion of so many peoples on wikipedia, a source that is edited by anyone, people such as the madman who thinks that only ``blacks`` exist in Africa, which is as the world knows false and an absurd proposition. The fact that you keep removing my posts and allow his to remain is very strange. I am contacting wikipedia at once.`;1293;1.0

You asked for help, well to wikify an article it means adding appropriate sections (which it has) and linking internally to other article which are relevant, for more info see Wikipedia:Wikify. For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain.

THANKS!!   NEWLINE_TOKEN== Hey ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVery strange.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou know what? Ashnard reminds me of Colonel Volgin. (You've played MGS:3 I assume.)NEWLINE_TOKENThat's not good, by the way... do you like him too? Just picking on you, but still... it's a weird character to like soooo much. If it makes you feel better, I didn't like Ike too much, but don't you dare talk crap about Greil. Err. See you around, Ol' King Daein. Peregrine NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Yes, I have played MGS3, I love that game, I am also quite partial to Greil (although I prefer to call him Gawain). Ashnard is quite like Volgin, but Ashnard isn't a bisexual pervert. So...Thanks for the comment, I'm really starting to get use to this place.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is true!!! You have a good point on me, there. Haha, well... You make SURE you have fun here on wikipedia. And, on a side note: Ivan is hardly a man. Happy editing.  Peregrine NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I will, by the way, have you noticed that Rolf from Path of Radiance seems incredibly ...effeminite? That boy must be the campest thing in videogames (besides Tingle). I mean, he seeks support from Mist.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh, Rolf... give him a chance. Atleast he's not an idiot like Boyd, or walking around with his eyes closed all the time like Oscar! He's still a kid, he could, uh... ya know, toughen up as he ages. (Maybe we'll see in GoD, who knows? Sothe definetely came a long way... if he just ditched that belly shirt) Plus, he's a sniper...so snipers rock, right? Tingle frightens me to my core, ahhh. I am not fond of that fairy-loving, body suit wearing freak with little man boobies. Have you played Twilight Princess? Looking back I don't think Tingle was in it at all. Thank goodness. Well, see-ya. Peregrine NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Let's hope Rolf doesn't end up like Sothe (who looks like a medieval rent boy). Snipers rock... Rolf doesn't, Shinon is legendrary, as is Will and Rebecca, yet Rolf seems to degrade (or spoil) the whole class. As for Oscar and Boyd? Well, Oscar cooks the meals and Boyd is better with a bow than Rolf. Tingle gives me nightmares, he reaches the daunting heights of Raikov and Rolf in being androgynous, I'm still aggrovated that he charged me so many rupees in The Wind Waker. Who are the guys that creates these characters? Y'know, this discussion is giving me an idea for an article...THE MOST SEXUALLY AMBIGUOUS CHARACTERS OF VIDEOGAMES!!! Only joking, bye.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh...Ashnard. It'd be unfortunate if you made an article like that. See, you'd realize shortly thereafter that just about every great game would have more than one character on that very list. I guess I'd have to admit now that I guess I DO like Shinon a whole lot, and I guess, maybe I agree that perhaps someone more... experienced (and someone with more of a personality) should've become commander after that whole, incident. (Pah.) Who (in your game) was better as a sniper, Wil or Rebecca? I have not beaten Rekka no Ken, I'm on Chapter 19 Gaiden, I played as Hector the first time thru because I never realized it was something that was unlocked by the person who owned the game before me. I don't mind. I believe that Hector is the man, yes? Well I should really stop talking now. Later. Peregrine NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Shinon was cool, but he was left eating humble pie later on when Ike beat him down, I liked his personality, but I'm still annoyed that he and Gatrie ran off, leaving me with the inexperienced rabble that is Rhys and co, to think I wasted experience on him (pah). Rekka no Ken is absolutley excellent, it's just as good as PoR (SS is nowhere near as good),Wil is roughly on par with Rebecca, although it is really laborious getting Rebecca up (she starts really weak). I'm kind of an FE addict, so I've completed all gaiden chapters (even the Kishuna ones). Hector really is the man, one of the best Lords, as for Ike, surprisingly,he probably has the deepest personaliy for a lord, now Eliwood is the one who is uncharismatic. You really should complete this game.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou were ticked about that? Hmph. (I guess I was a little, hell... ok. It sucked) You gotta think about how crappy it would feel to have loser Ike in charge, he had been a mercenary for a couple days!Honestly it would've made perfect since to leave Titania in charge. (Although I have a sneaking suspicion it still wouldn't have appeased Shinon, he loved Greil and he was really just having a hissy-fit. You know how those mid-life crisis are.)

Peregrine NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Yes, I have played MGS3, I love that game, I am also quite partial to Greil (although I prefer to call him Gawain).

Rolf doesn't, Shinon is legendrary, as is Will and Rebecca, yet Rolf seems to degrade (or spoil) the whole class. As for Oscar and Boyd? Well, Oscar cooks the meals and Boyd is better with a bow than Rolf.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh...Ashnard. It'd be unfortunate if you made an article like that. See, you'd realize shortly thereafter that just about every great game would have more than one character on that very list. I guess I'd have to admit now that I guess I DO like Shinon a whole lot, and I guess, maybe I agree that perhaps someone more... experienced (and someone with more of a personality) should've become commander after that whole, incident. (Pah.) Who (in your game) was better as a sniper, Wil or Rebecca? I have not beaten Rekka no Ken, I'm on Chapter 19 Gaiden, I played as Hector the first time thru because I never realized it was something that was unlocked by the person who owned the game before me.

Rekka no Ken is absolutley excellent, it's just as good as PoR (SS is nowhere near as good),Wil is roughly on par with Rebecca, although it is really laborious getting Rebecca up (she starts really weak). I'm kind of an FE addict, so I've completed all gaiden chapters (even the Kishuna ones).

A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me.

If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed.

125483566;"`==Correct and True Etymology of English words ``Myth, Mythology``==NEWLINE_TOKENGreek μυθολογια ``legend, storytelling`` is derived from μυθος ``speech, thought, story, myth``, itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning ``an exposition of myths``. The current meaning of ``body of myths`` itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of ``untrue story``:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history.`` Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::This is the earliest known usage of ``myth`` in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English ``fabulous`` doesn't mean ``wonderfully aesthetic``, it is the adjectival form of ``fable``, that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term ``myth`` was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things ``by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history.``.  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define ``myth`` today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 2005, a single-purpose account added ``mythology categories`` to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of ``mythology`` and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJust last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article ``Yoruba mythology`` to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term ``mythology`` is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from ``mythology``, but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as ``mythology``.  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran ``mythology`` either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today ``mythology``.     NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as ``mythology`` for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of ``mythology`` for these.  But please realize that this is not the case with Christian, Muslim or Bahai writings, nor indeed the writings of many other living religions.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`";3652;1.0

126018634;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== A few questions about the block ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am curious about a couple of things regarding your blocking event.  First, what led you to believe that I had anything to do with this ?  I've looked at some of his edits (inactive since September, mind you), and I guess you were seeing that we were both editing wrestling pages.  That's a blockable offense on Wikipedia?  The reason I happened to hit some wrestling pages was because I was looking for WP:BLP violations, and I happened to begin with Ko Jong-Soo (not a wrestler) and was working my way down a list, alphabetically.  While working on pages about a poet, a model, a football player, and a businessman, I wandered into a wrestler or two, and BAM, I get blocked from editing Wikipedia.  How intolerant is that?  Second, you recommended that I join WP:ADOPT, when in fact if you would have spent two seconds looking at my User page, I've had the Adoption template posted since late February!  (Still not adopted yet.)  I guess what I'm saying is that you've shown some measurable level of disregard for me as a thoughtful editor of Wikipedia, and yet your ``tone`` (if I may call it that) suggests I should be very humble and apologetic toward you.  Why is that?  Is there some ``royal status`` on Wikipedia, of which I'm not yet aware?  `;3574;1.0
126107000;`NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENRemoving information over and over again from an article isn't vandalism? If so then I'll just cut out the parts of the site that I don't agree with as people have done to the infantry page.

126141412;`NEWLINE_TOKEN::So, just to be clear... Did you take any action against those Wikipedia users who labeled another user as a ``terrorist``, ``stalker``, and ``criminal``, without any supporting factual evidence and without having contacted the authorities?  I'm very confused about how things work on Wikipedia.  It appears that it's okay to call other people names that are in no way ``nice``, but if someone mentions that this sort of behavior could be considered (I won't say the word, but it starts with the letter ``L`` and it rhymes with ``Bible``), that is an ``indef blockable`` offense? Are you taking sides in the matter, and challenging only the after-the-fact ``legal threats``?  Or, have you been equal in counseling restraint among those who use inflammatory labels to malign other users?  `;3512;1.0

127059233;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYOU PEOPLE ARE AT IT AGAIN.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHe first started achieving major public notoriety in early 2007, when he made complaints of harassment at Columbia University, against students who allegedly called him a ``baby killer`` for being in the militaryNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo, he first made his complaints in early 2006. This gained him attention at Columbia. Then he wrote articles for a student newspaper, a military newspaper and on some right-wing blogs. That got him noticed by national right-wing media, i.e., Fox News. In late 2006, left-wing students publicized his pornography background. It was largely ignored.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThen he got the CPAC award on the same day that Ann Coulter made her comment about John Edwards. That caused the gay blogs to dig up what had been reported in late '06. The story of CPAC applauding Coulter while honoring a gay porn star and hooked spread to non-gay liberal blogs, and then to MSNBC's Countdown. That's how it became a national story.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the ensuing controversy, it became public knowledge that Sanchez himself had been a performer in homosexual/bisexual[4] adult films in the early 1990s. The story became popular in the blogosphere, especially among homosexual bloggers who insinuated rumors about the details of Sanchez's past.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSanchez appears in 38 gay porn movies. About 15 of them are originals, the rest re-compilations. Of the 38 videos, one is titled ``Bi Conflict,`` but in that video Sanchez performs homosexual acts. Sanchez has never had anything other than gay sex on film. These are not ``homosexual/bisexual films.`` He is a gay porn actor who appeared in gay porn films for gay viewers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere has been no ``insinuation`` of ``rumors.`` Rather, there has been reporting of solid evidence. Sanchez prostituted under the name Excellent Top between 1999 and 2002, and operated the No Regrets Massage service, a front for prostitution, in 2004. He directly admitted prostitution in an appearance on the Alan Colmes show on March 8, 2007, and in an article published the same day on Salon.comNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSanchez revealed that Countdown never bothered to contact him before running the television report. Countdown sourced several gay blogs to complete the report, as well as committed left-wing ideologue Max Blumenthal who claimed that Sanchez was apart of a greater ``an underground railroad`` for fallen gay right-wingers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCalling Bluemental ``a committed left-wing ideologue`` is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor script. It is an outrageous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. So is saying that Sanchez ``revealed`` that Countdown ``never bothered`` to contact him.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCritics charge that Sanchez has given conflicting statements about rumors from anonymous bloggers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe use of the phrase ``rumors from anonymous bloggers`` is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor, an is an outraegous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. First off, they are not rumors. Remember, the so-called ``rumors`` have proven true. Secondly, most bloggers are anonymous. This does not by itself indict them or the information they provide, any more than a newspaper story without a byline indicts the newspaper that prints it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an op-ed piece in Salon.com, Sanchez likened porn to prostitution, he subsequently said he wanted to draw that same analogy on his first appearances on Colmes Radio show.``[24]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst off, whatever he claimed that he had ``wanted`` to do on Colmes is immaterial. The Colmes interview stands on its own. Secondly, he made the claim about what he ``wanted`` to do on a blog. But this time, it was on a right-wing ``ex-gay`` blog. Since when does Wikipedia elevation right-wing ex-gay blogs to a superior status? Some ``neutrality`` you people show!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA later report by the same writer appeared on April 1, 2007, indicating that Sanchez was also being investigated by the Marine Corps for fraudulently soliciting funds from two organizations, the United War Veteran's Council and U-Haul, in order to fund a deployment to Iraq which he never actually made. Sanchez has denied the charges; saying that he never collected money from either organization.[25]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENExcuse me, but Sanchez's denial of fraudulent solicitation is a non-denial. In fact, Sanchez admitted soliciting the money. Whether or not he collected it has no bearing on whether or not he solicited it. Those are two separate issues. Extortion doesn't have to succeed to be extortion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is a larger point to be made here, which is that Sanchez's various explataions have been a circus of multi-contradictions. It is not ``neutral`` to split the difference. Facts are neutral. So report the facts. How hard is it to report the facts?`";1489;1.0

127892315;"` 2007 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Hi.  The original ``Land Of Confusion`` song/video were in existence for 2 decades before Disturbed decided to cover it.  Adding such an overwhelming amount of info on Disturbed's cover version distorted readers' analysis of the original song/video. (For what it's worth, I personally don't even care for Genesis at all, nor do I have any special fondness for this song/ video, though the video's puppetry was fairly innovative in its day.)  But I & others felt the article was being pillaged by Disturbed fans, and thus Wikipedia was being compromised in the process.  The article is much more fairly balanced now, and gives appropriate coverage to Disturbed's version.  So I have no regrets about how I edited it, nor do I have a problem with what you added back, since I think you added back a judicious amount... though the huge Infobox is pushing things a bit. (I only made that one edit to the article & had forgotten all about it until just now.) As user Robotman1974 posted back on Jan. 16th, ``Right now the word counts of the main parts of the Genesis version vs the Disturbed version are 775 to 996 respectively.``  So you see, the word count (showing clear bias in favor of Disturbed's version over the original version) is what motivated my pruning.  I do welcome your further thoughts on this, though, since I realize Disturbed probably spent a lot of time and money on making that video, & they are a bit more highbrow than most ``nu-metal`` bands of today. And I agree with you that their cover version is more notable than most, since theirs did very well on the charts (though I never even knew theirs existed until I stumbled onto this article).  The only recourse that would make both sides happy is to make an entire new article devoted to Disturbed's version. I would be in favor of that; this would allow you to add back all the info I deleted initially.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBest, and good luck in the governor's race,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN 06:30, 3 May`";1322;1.0

As for the snapping sound, using common sense, yet, again, a tiny canary's neck snapping could, and probably does, sound like a human's fingers snapping; you expect some loud CRACK with onomatopoeia on the screen? Besides the ``finger snapping`` theory, which, being the only real theory that could contest the accepted one, can't possibly hold up, without assuming the unverifiable idea that 47 uber-trained his bird, there is no other way you can explain the bird being silenced that isn't totally outlandish and basically unbelievable. Also, if you try to use the ``I'm following the rules`` clause, taking into account that Wikipedia isn't a beaucracy and that the sheer existence of this conversation is ridiculous, the statement that says 47 kills his bird should stay. I mean, come on man.

127952260;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think this talk page is proof that there is not a community consensus to remove all mention of the number from this story.  Some people have had their edits deleted, or respected requests not to post the number pending a decision, but that's not exactly the same thing.  Nor is it unusual for Wikipedia (or any public communication) to operate on shaky legal ground - for example, every time a ``fair use`` image is posted.  The rationale for this particular restriction seems even more dubious than most, though - I just looked up the ``take-down notice`` sent to one of the original Web sites, which says, ``It is our understanding that you are providing ... and offering to the public a technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof that is primarily designed, produced, or marketed for the purpose of circumventing the technological protection ...``  Now I don't know if that's true of the original site when the code was less well known, but by this point the encyclopedic value of including the code (for instance, so that editors can do a Google search for all 298,000 pages or subsets thereof to track its progress through the Internet and see what policies different Internet services are adopting) is far in excess of the circumvention value of the code (which has been revoked anyway, according to this article, and which is already so widely accessible that it is totally implausible that censoring this one site can stop a person from finding it and cracking a DVD using it if he is so minded and otherwise able to do so).  To claim that this encyclopedia page is primarily designed, produced, or marketed to crack DVDs would be utterly absurd.  `;1061;1.0

129711007;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAre you excusing me of trying to disparage Catholics? I am certainly not. I am only trying to include them in the correct categories because it is FACTS that are essential to Irish history. The only reason Hackney wants these categories taken out is because he hates Irish people and does not want the full truth to be revealed on wikipedia. The Roman Catholic category added to any of them is factual, yet, Hackney continues to remove it. This should be considered vandalism. You also notice that Hackney isn't removing any categories from any English people or any other people, he is only sabotaging pages of Irish Catholics, specifically the hunger martyrs.  ;1167;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENWho cares what they decided in 1950. It was already the cold war offcourse they will try to suck-up to ex-Nazis to tear the Soviet Union from the inside. They were involved in the holocaust, it's a fact, ask any Estonian Jew. Jews always were in every independence movement so somwhere they would be excepted. I saw a ducumentary with Jews from Estonia who menneged to escape with the Soviets, and also Estinian vitnesses, and they told how Estonians closed hundreeds of Jews in every synogoge and burned them down. You're right about what was with the Jews in USSR (I'm half Jewish, my mother is Jewish, and my grand-grandpa set in Jail there for a short time for teaching Hebrew), but nevertheless, the Soviets didn't give to Estonians to make pogroms at Jews. By the way, at the days of the Tallin Liberator reburial there were many interviews with Jews from Estonia telling how Estonians murdered their people then. NEWLINE_TOKENAll the Jewqish community activities in the 80s and 90s was spoonsored by the Jews, and dont forget in 1987-1989 it was still the Soviet Union. Estonia is desperate for world support, thats why for now the Jews are safe there. Offcourse there are Jews among the writers of the article, but there are also Estonians. M.V.E.i. ;1396;1.0

I was the first to say that there was no gang rape at Duke, not because they were fine white boys and the woman was a ho, but because rapes don’t, don’t, don’t happen that way.  Of course the white supremacists have already found a “rape,” based on leaked information from some deputy of a black on white gang rape, which was printed in tabloid journalism, is now on David Duke’s page, and in Wikipedia.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia is supposed to work because although people have differing opinions, there is supposed to be some consensus other wise it’s just endless revert war.  Obviously there is no serious agreement if a gang rape occurred (although to be fair to the deranged alleged victim, it does appear that she suffered from similar events in past) but there is no way that the self proclaimed “Unlearned Hand” can think that there is  agreement on all the items they reverted.

They are all external links. They all ``tunnel people away from the wikipedia.`` So why then are you singling out a single website and removing all of the links to their reviews?

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'd also like to add that it is people like you who make me not want to contribute to Wikipedia, and the reason I've never joined.

It’s disturbing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf someone read Wikipedia articles related to Yugoslav Wars and base solely on them as a source of research (as many and many students in US and around the world do today), he or she will ``learn`` that ``the ``Holy Serbs were victims, the USA/NATO/Albanian/Croats/Muslims ere the villains, and a great injustice was made to the innocent Holy Serb population that never made anything wrong in History but to defend themselves from the aggressors``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is gross revisionism of one of the worst atrocities of Europe in the second half of 20th century. It's like to put the blame of the Holocaust on Poland and the Jewish people rather then on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut the most incredible thing is that this radical nationalist vision are winning the game here in Wikipedia. The SRS Cabal editors use extreme pressure, group action and extreme edit techniques (and they're not usually caught on Wikipedia anti-edit war barriers, since they act as a collectivity) they are imposing their vision without constraints. People who try to question them or make any kind of edit that contradicts their rhetoric are hardly harassed in their Talk Pages and the talk Pages of the articles. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd what is worse of all, thy use the Administration of Wikipedia and the rules of Wikipedia  to achieve their goals.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese people know very well the functioning of the tools of power and management in Wikipedia, and they use this knowledge to pressure, to block, and finally to silent editor who defy the radical nationalist ideology. Like many other authoritarian organizations, they use collective organized pressure to neutralize individual dissenters. And they go unpunished.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI’m saying this because I've been visiting many user pages of people who have been tried to make more balanced articles about Yugoslav matters here in Wikipedia, and when I saw their Talk pages I generally saw infinite hellish arguments with editor from the SRS-like Cabal, many adverts, many blockings… and many editor who simply ceased to edit anymore because all of this.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSadly, I don't know what to do. I would like very much to find a way to counter-balance these editors, but I don't know how.

131840564;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I will freely admit, anonymous users as a whole seem to disagree with me. I am trying to be fair to the article. It is not entirely unsourced, there is information linked from the CBRM website, lets make that clear. My problem is with the agrument ``Everyone knows it``. I live in Glace Bay, John's home town. I've asked me thinking I was some kind of idoit for now knowing John's IQ score. Apparently every person I ask is also an idoit. It seems clearly placed to bias John as a smart guy because everyone knows he is to an extend. Any accusation, be it accused of being a member of a high IQ society or being accused or taking long walks on the beach is not encyclopedic, espeically if it is policitical and biased. For example, what if someone accuses John of being a bigot, do we include that to? What about if they accuse me of hating poor people? No because while it is fact he was accused, anyone can accuse anyone of anything just to have it included in an article. In fact, I accuse John of eatting Africian babies. There, now it should be added under your logic. I checked Trudeau, Nixon and  Hillary Clinton I CANNOT find an IQ or a High IQ society listed. AGAIN, my challage is still open. By the way, while statsically rare, the amount of people who become policiatins is low as well. I am not trying to be be stubburn, I have a simple test I am employing a simple test that is not being met here. Also, it is not encyclopedic, which is the whole point of Wikipedia. If you cannot understand that I am following Wikipedia policy or disagree with Wikipedia policy, you should not edit Wikipedia. Again I have asked for a third opinion on the subject.  `;988;1.0

132052190;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Concerns about Arvanites as Albanian origin group is not a trolling.== NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Trolling refers to deliberate and intentional attempts to disrupt the usability of Wikipedia for its editors, administrators, developers, and other people who work to create content for and help run Wikipedia. Trolling is deliberate violation of the implicit rules of Internet social spaces. It necessarily involves a value judgment made by one user about the value of another's contribution.”.   My action and my opinion has nothing to do with trolling, if this is a reasons for you to delete what I write this is something else. The article I think has to express more extensive work and different background contributor’s then simple group of usual users. I encourage people with Arvanitic origin and  Albanians to participate in discussions, therefore this article will be much more accurate and fare from bias. Dodona;1167;1.0

132760067;I would suggest that the conversion to the more strict source format be done first just as a formatting change, leaving unsourced statement in place, but more clearly tagged as needing improvements in sourcing.  That would be a less drastic step than just tossing anything that is unsourced.  However editors have the right to cut unsourced material at any time, per Wikipedia:Verifiability.  Another alternative method is to move unsourced statements to the talk page pending rework or sourcing.  My sense is that this article needs to be completely rewritten, which will take several months, and that the safest approach for a team effort would be to make just small incremental edits that can be carefully considered and judged by the team.  A massive rewrite would not be consistent with a team effort.  If we get no objections to the proposal to improve note format, I am willing to help work on the format pass.

133035858;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== M-hmmmmmm....... ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be ``stricken down`` as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Ok, ``.com`` stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that ``.co.uk`` is explicitly UK, and that ``.com`` can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- ``Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.``NEWLINE_TOKEN    NEWLINE_TOKEN I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - ``American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- My point wasn't ``British are the only people that use British spelling.`` (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that ``The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English.``. If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- ``But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds`` NEWLINE_TOKENAgain, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like ``PAH-EHD-OH-FILE``, adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced ``PE-DOH-FILE``, which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue.

Lol, anyways, did I say that leaving Wikipedia just the way it is results in a less informative encyclopedia? I said no such thing! My argument is that the inherent nature of an encyclopedia is that ALL of the information is based on one standard, so the reader doesn't get confused, and that this inherent nature must be present in Wikipedia as well! It's like trying to subtract X from Z, and expecting a numerical answer, it just doesn't mutually comply, and doesn't work well with an organized, compiled database of informative facts. I agree with you 100% that enhancing your knowledge of dialects is important, but it's just as important as learning how gum is made, learning more about George Washington, and learning what blood is made of, in a relative sense. And this is EXACTLY why there was an article on American/British spelling differences, just as there are articles for chewing gum, George Washington, and blood, and EXACTLY why I chose to raise this issue on that certain articles Talk Page. That's what encyclopedias are for, LEARNING, but learning at your OWN careful and deliberate discretion, not someone elses.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOk, sir, my mistake for not checking my facts, but I just assumed, obviously wrongly, that words like ``pedophile`` are pronounced the same in both British and American dialects, but only because I've heard British people pronounce pedophile as ``PED-OH-PHILE``. So, like a normal intelligent person would do, they would make a claim with a reasonable logic base, and not just personal agenda. And you seem to think that I've never heard of that ``ae`` being merged as one letter, do you seriously take me as a fool? Hope not, beause only a fool and an intellect would raise this issue in the first place, and I am by NO means a fool. Well, I've made mistakes in my past, but so has everybody, right? But in the scholastic sense, I am no fool, at all. Anyways, just incase you AGAIN misread what I wrote, I didn't claim to believe they pronounce it ``PAH-EHD-OH-PHILE``, I was just giving an example for my statement ``there are words common in both the British and English dialect that in the British dialect aren't spelled as pronounced``. I assumed, based on my reasonings in the first sentence of this paragraph, that both the British and Americans pronounce this word, and similar words, identically. According to you, I am false on this, but I do not have much faith in your credibility, so I will have to look deeper into this one. ANYWAYS, the reason I even made this argument is that you rebutted my original statement that read somewhere along the lines of ``generally speaking, English words are pronounced as spelled, letter-by-letter`` with the fact that the word ``color`` is spelled ``colour`` in Britain, yet it is pronounced ``CUH-LIHR``.

Where is the `` denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??NEWLINE_TOKEN   I stated an increase from 11% that somebody else place here from CIA to 46%, that's an increase of 35. So I am the anti-black, racist,denier??? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN   I knew that you where going to throw the `` Moor myth`` about Spaniards, you are showing the radical afrocentric nut. What's next? you also believe in Van Sertima's book, that the Olmec heads of the Yucatan peninsula are Africans? or that snow is really black??NEWLINE_TOKEN   DNA studies in Spaniards show that less than 2% have Moor blood. It has been weed out,since the fall of Cordova in 1236, by the `` limpieza de sangre`` campaign of the christians. Spaniards are White as are the anglo-saxons,and the Irish. I'm not going into deep details about `` Moors and Spain`` with a radical Afrocentric nut, but going back to the article, we are not going to allow that the DR article is going to get hijack by radical afrocentric nut, nor eurocentric too. As you can see, I'm not eurocentric, 16% white to 2% white, do the math. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN    You think that you where going to deal with an ignoramus, but when it comes to history, you are kindergarten compared to me. You say `` society`` says that such words are offensive? wow, impresive answer. you are a clown.

OH LORD ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  51% euro/black and 46% black,that is 46% afro decent and 51% afro-mixed decent,that makes it neutral, becuase Mulatto is a separate racial group, they view themselves different from the Blacks. Now, if you have a problem with that, which you certainly have, then that don't belong in this article.

You can go and take your radical afrocentrism to Maulana Karenga.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENand example is the demographics that show about El Salvador in wiki, it says `` 90% mestizo,9% white,1% indian``. In my personal opinion, Indian might be more percentage, some mestizos might look `` more indian than 50/50 or 40/60. Since Mestizos DUE view themselves different from Indians, why don't you go and invade the article and type `` 91% of Salvadoreans are of amerindian decent``.  90% amerindian-mixed population `` doesn't equate to `` amerinidan decent``. that just creates confusion.

133519943;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst, about trying to recruit outside support in revert wars, it simply does not work. I mean it may work for a day or two, perhaps a week even, but few of the recruited users actually stay and those who do were likely to come here anyway. A relative small minority of Ukrainian (or Russian or Polish or other E. European) public can really contribute to en-wiki as this requires individuals with a huge interest, involvement, good internet access, relative well-being in RL (one is unlikely to be able to commit time to the project when one really struggles to put bread on the table, has to battle health problems and other real life disasters), good English, etc., etc., etc. As you see, this limits the pool of potential contributors to a very small segment and posting calls at internet forums will unlikely affect the number of the users who will stay.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbout nationalists, all nationalists have a hard time at Wikipedia and most long-term users are those with moderate views. Strongly nationalist editors find themselves in trouble soon enough and I am familiar with several instances of Russian nationalist users ending up banned or having left due to ``frustration``. Wikipedia is a more welcome place to moderate editors, be them Ukraino-, Russo- or Polonophile. Contrary to your assertion, there are several actively working Ukrainian editors right now and they manage to not run into any trouble. And there are also users who manage to get in trouble all the time. Now, to the user in question, I would agree that he is somewhat exceptional in that he may be called a Russian nationalist indeed and he gets in trouble only on the very rare occasions. However, the important distinction is that the user's activity in Wikipedia goes by far beyond picking and fighting the nationalist crusades and running endless revert wars. User contributes a whole lot of content to the project and some topics of his interest and giant contributions have no relation to the nationalism whatsoever. There is another thing, though, which makes this user different from his opponents he mentions in the link you provide. In the UA-RU conflicts where the user is involved he does not scatter the general hatred towards the Ukrainians, something that his opponents do all the time in their talk page entries and edit summaries. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI agree that when sides blame each other all the time, mutual animosity and distrust is inevitable. Point is that only a small part of each ``side`` play this game, and the rest manage to get along without developing the hatred and distrust.  `;373;1.0

Your edits are constantly excluding this sourced view as they claim that the dialect is simply a dialect of Polish, nothing else.

During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, , which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', , which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself.   Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards,  :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is,  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes.

This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question.``. And few minutes later, you posted ``24 hour block issued``.NEWLINE_TOKEN::#All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.NEWLINE_TOKEN::#You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.NEWLINE_TOKEN::#In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.NEWLINE_TOKEN::The reasons why you did it:NEWLINE_TOKEN::#It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.NEWLINE_TOKEN::#You neither told me not to remove that stuff.NEWLINE_TOKEN::#I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.NEWLINE_TOKEN::#I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.NEWLINE_TOKEN::In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.NEWLINE_TOKEN::And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.NEWLINE_TOKEN::In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:NEWLINE_TOKEN::``Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block?

135516514;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== per physical appearance ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn regards to your question about adding more pictures, one of the main concerns of editors on the MJ page is that the pictures are cluttering up the text and making it more difficult to read. I would have to agree with this concern: as nice as pictures are, wikipedia is about information and this is conveyed through text and to-the-point pictures. I think that putting pictures documenting the change in Michael's appearance would draw undue attention to that facet of his life. Sure, a few pictures are good, but these show him in some important light, whether in a record-breaking video, or on the cover of one of his record-breaking albums, or during a popular performance. That leads me on to your other query, about using images from live, recent events. The only problem there is that, IMO, the picture quality decreases and that brings recentism to the article. Basically, it's focussing too much on the present, whereas wikipedia is meant to equally document MJ's entire life. Finally, regards the 80s picture, I was actually against it a while back, and tried to replace it with a then-recent picture of his acceptance of a 'Legend Award' in Japan. I didn't manage this successfully, but then I realized that the current picture is probably the best one to be there. It is the perfect representation of MJ, in the prime of his career, epitomizing the success that he was, and IMO still is.

135517982;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Your comment on Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Edward Behr (food writer) ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe upshot of your statement was that I had made the nomination in bad faith.  I don't think this case is much different from any other contested speedy or prod that is forwarded to AFD - this happens many times every day.  The only difference is that I found out that the speedy had been declined by way of someone opposing me at RFA for being a trigger-happy deletionist.  My first reaction was anger; my second reaction was to reexamine my judgment and see if I really had made a mistake.  I decided that there might indeed be grounds to delete, hence the AFD.  I do not really care about the result: I've been wrong before, and it won't affect the RFA which is currently failing.  But I do care about my reputation, and I will not keep silent when my motives are called into question.  I apologize for the harsh tone because I can't find a calmer way to voice my frustration.  `";0;1.0

Up until now I've been prepared to take your edits in good faith and to assume that you've been trying to make a valid contribution to Wikipedia but you've been told about the policies here so many times that your continued violations leave me with no choice but to assume you're pushing some bizarre personal agenda. I'm going to lay things out for you here:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::* There is no evidence whatsoever in any of your cited references to support the view that JK has any socialist leanings whatsoever.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::* You consistently try to assert that she is a socialist by making quantum leaps between the stated facts and your position by using them to infer that she has certain leanings/supports certain causes/ideologies.NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::* Many of your arguments and inferences see Fawkes above are just plain incorrect.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::I would strongly urge you to please stop grinding this particular axe or I don't how we will resolve this in any way other than asking for arbitration and that's never a fun process. Again, this is not a personal attack - many of the points you have raised are valid and interesting ones when you've backed them up with reliable sources but you seem determined to take things just one step too far by inferring meanings and links that simply aren't there.  `;2825;1.0

Infact considering what has occured in his life it is an achievement he has any fans. The reason for this is that many believe he is a good person especially in the light of his tireless charity work. Everyone is entitled to an opinion that is a democracy thank god but it is wrong to attack others. If I am not as educated as you does that make my opinons any less valid?

138523698;`I don't know anyone who has entertained the belief that Bacon had buggered Jonson. As for his servants, that may be a different matter. Bray suspects that it may have been the money Bacon gave them that brought the matter to notice: certainly, homosexual relations between masters and servants were clearly common enough to provoke the satirists. As for the weight allotted to it in the article: this is a classic situation in Wikipedia. Any implication of homosexuality in an historical figure has to be detailed and fully referenced beyond normal expectation, otherwise it is then accused of being an unsupported allegation, with the resulting endless edit war. In addition, the earlier point made on this thread about including it: ``Because a significant amount of modern scholarship is focused on how it affected the development of his ontology`` is extremely valid. The growth of gay studies departments within universities in recent years, and the flood of research and interpretation, is having a significant impact, and is literally re-writing history. To give a tiny example: the discoveries and interpretations in Crompton's 'Byron and Greek Love' have affected every Byron biography published after 1985. Multiply this a thousand times, and one gets an idea of the tsunami of change. For the homophobic this presents a confronting situation, but it's the reality. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`;1917;1.0

138580618;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Deletions ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou deleted Sommer Isdale, Holly Shively and Annilie Hastey without correctly interpreting the debates.  In the case of Holly Shively, you left no message which I thought was strange in such a mixed case.  There were 6 votes to keep, and about 8 to delete. I can't see how this could have ended up in any result but no consensus - not just because of the numbers but because of the sensible arguments on either side.  You also deleted Sommer Isdale while completely ignoring the strong argument made by After Midnight, again this should at least have been no consensus.  Finally, in the case of Annilie Hastey, you deleted it even though there were more comments suggesting that the article be kept. Again here you claimed crystal ballery, but the majority of comments didn't even touch on this.  I am letting you know that I would like you to reconsider these deletions, and to let you know that when you have had a chance to respond I am taking this to Deletion Review because I think these deletions were unfair.  I feel I have a fairly good case, because in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kari Schull, an article in the same series was closed as keep.  ;845;1.0

139129209;- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me.

(And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here.

139305500;`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::The phrase ``Cease and Desist`` is actually a staple of aggressive lawyers going after people who are crossing their clients, but in the environment of Wikipedia, especially coming from an admin to a non-admin, it has the tone of a shout from a law enforcement officer to an unarmed civilian. I reverted your comment on my Talk in a little tit-for-tat snit, but then I remembered I never, ever, revert anything on non-encyc pages, so I reverted the revert. One of the many vital functions of Talk pages is the ``blowing off steam`` function and, aside from the lowest sort of profanity-laced invective, emotional wording should not be discouraged by beating people with the WP:CIVIL and WP:POINT sticks as punishment for being human...The moral of the story is: if ``the people`` (in this case, general editors) are upset over a policy, don't be browbeating them when they speak out against it in non-encyc pages. A guy can't give a heartfelt opinion around here anymore without getting slapped with 8 or 9 ``policy violations`` right off the bat. ps - I appreciate your restoring my edit. It really isn't hurting anyone.   `;1098;1.0

Not having those covers on the artist's page iz an outrage.  For years wikipedia had the policy of having the wikitable with the album covers on them.  But then in 2007 some administrators (aka nerds with power on wikipedia/tyrants) decided that even though wikipedia will never be sued for this action, that they were gonna take all the album cover off the pages.  But a few bold editers such as my self, did not except nor like this change and continued to put the album cover on the page due to the fact that's where they belong.  I have been blocked 3 times for this and am sick of it.  I'm not saying all administrators are a bad, I have even read comments by some that said that they would rather have the covers included.  I also was visiting a admi. page and read ``Even the most anti-album cover administrater agrees that wikipedia will never be sued for the album covers.  You know what I'm sayin' Loc?  We want album covers, man.  Whether it be you, Steel, Spellcast, Mel Ethis, Shadyaftermathgunito or whoever keeps deleting the album covers, you guys got to stop.  Do you guys get paid for every album cover you remove?  That is the only reason I can think of for you guys being so anti-album cover.  Damn, we only live once.

Can't figure exactly which comment caused the upset ( The Tomb of ... maybe?), the poppers article, ..... probably just not agreeing with most of the current pet ideas ( I'm shakist on global warming but getting more and more convinced evey day. ) Don't you like the ad hominem of wiki - I've been accused, once I was guilty ( I got frustrated at a blatant lie and deception, but I wouldn't again I hope ), but I think I am more ad hominened against than the ad hominener ). Browsing the editorss pages/comments it appears they seem to dislike the ideas but have a hard time finding a problem ( Do they really think you can cremate a body with it's own fat? This item was finally removed from the article ( Holocaust I think ) but I noticed that it has crept back in ( less prominent but still they wont giveup on Vrba even though Hilberg thinks he is nuts ``unreliable``. ) I hope that a link to a modern cremation site can clear up the science and facts - however I doubt it ever makes the main article ( which seems immune from the intrusion of science ). I could go on with many more - I always assumed that the talk page was to talk about the subject - not the grammar, etc - If only the same ideas are wanted then maybe the talk pages are redundant - at least on what appears to be politically charged issues. I'll write to Jimbo in a few weeks to see his opinion. Well, good luck - hope it's not too hot out there. `;489;1.0

140731182;`NEWLINE_TOKEN== I have some things to say ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirstly, I find it hard to believe that Allah is the same God as my God, i.e, the Judeio-Christian God. Secondly, Why can't Muslims put up with Religous humor like Christians, Jews, and other straight thinking folks?-NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: With all due respect, Muslims are no less humour-tolerant than many groups throughout the history of other religions.  One of the funniest people I have ever met was a Muslim.  The trick is that fanatical muslims have no sense of humour, much the same way fanatical christians, jews, sikhs, or anyone else have poor senses of humour.  It is in fanaticism that we close our minds, and therefore lose the joy that comes with an open mind.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: On the topic of Allah - you're going to have to deal with it.  (Well, you don't HAVE to, I suppose... )   I know you may find it hard to believe, but you need to move past the lens of your experience with muslims or with others' ideas about islam.  The fact that you call non-muslims ``straight thinking folks`` should clue you in to the fact that you are taking a prejudiced view.  Have you studied the Qur'an?  I don't mean leafed through a copy at the book store, but actually studied it, with people who have also studied it with an open mind?  In the Qur'an, you find Jesus praised and loved, prophets sent by God to the hebrews (Noah, Isaiah, Elijah, Abraham, Moses, etc.) respected and honoured.  At the end of days, according to Islam, Jesus even returns just like in Christianity.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I'm not saying there aren't differences - big ones.  It's just that there's a difference between God's identity and His names.  Allah isn't God... Allah is a name of god.  God has many names.  In fact the word God didn't even start out as a name, it was a word - a noun.  In english usage, we started to use it as a proper noun, as a name.  That's an english thing, 1500 years after Jesus (around when English started to be modern English).  Arabs say ``the God`` in arabic.  That word, in Arabic, is Allah.  Christians from Arab lands use the same word to describe God the Father.   Jews sometimes have trouble thinking that Christians talk about the same God, because Christian concepts of God's nature and attributes are so different (in some formulations of Christianity) than the God of the hebrew Tanakh.  Nevertheless scholars and anyone who reads the texts realizes that even if their conceptions of God differ, they are trying, in their human and frail way, to describe the same unique being that created the universe.  The same is true with Muslims.  Cheers.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::crazyfurf, so you think Muslims don't fall under the straight thinking folks category? Anyway I don't see how this will help contribute to the article! so remove this section?   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENmaybe you should not ask any quetions or edite any pages of wikipedia, because after reading this i can see that your bias and possibly a racist.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Allah not a contraction of al-ilah! ==NEWLINE_TOKENInsert non-formatted text hereNEWLINE_TOKENWiki has alread stated, which is a proven fact, that Arabic speaking Jews or Christians used the name Allah before Islam. The following is a refutation of the al-ilah contraction theory and the allegation that Allah was a moon god (If this be then all Arabic speaking Jews and Christians will go to hell) Since Robert Morey Book Islamic Invasion is the leading propaganda on this topic we will use him as a bases of refutation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe have had the pleasure in reading his book called ``Islamic Invasion``. However his arguement was unheard of before his book was published. His sources that he quotes, that he misquoted and twisted out of their context, support no such allegation of his. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat Morey did was took various sources of information to asert a theory in the following. NEWLINE_TOKEN:1) The name (Allah) is linguistically, not etymologically, said to be in theory a contraction of the two Arabic words ``al ilah`` that means ``the god or The G-d``. NEWLINE_TOKEN:2) In Arabian pagan worship there was a supreme Idol called by the names Sin, Nanna, and Hubul which was known as a moon deity. NEWLINE_TOKEN:3) This moon god was given the designated title ``al ilah`` NEWLINE_TOKEN:4) the moon god was worshipped in Makkah at the Ka'abah known as Hubul NEWLINE_TOKEN:5) the symbol of Islam is the Crescent NEWLINE_TOKEN:6) the symbol of the moon god was the crescent NEWLINE_TOKEN:These are Morey's foundation to his arguement that he tied togther in his so called detective work. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnfortunately Morey was not the scholar that people thought he was. His research was not researched at which his prejudice thinking lead him to propagate something that was not. Also to remind everyone that the PHD label which was nicely adver;635;1.0

141176261;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Again, the Dom -> Rom theory is based on a supposed name connection (while there are plenty of such possibilities  of connections with words from the Subcontinent) and on a supposed connection between Domba's low status and the anti-Romani prejudices. Scientifc studies presented reasons for its' lack of substance and for the Rajput ancestry. Some supporters of Dom -> Rom reorganized later their theory, by including the points raised against its likeliness, by presenting the Ḍom as a cover-term for itinerant service-providing castes and the three group as originating in different areas within India, speaking different (albeit related) Indian languages, and probably leaving the Subcontinent at different times, taking different routes. It is too bad for Y. Matras dismissing, as always, the scientific approach as ``fantastic politically-inspired mythology`` and his opinion based on a mere resemblance of prejudices as the mainstream. I presented the evolution in time of the two theories, but I see that he deleted most of the scientific results (which btw inspired later the supporters of Dom -> Rom to make some adjustments in order to keep looking reliable). The Wikipedia is based on consensus, so you can't have your separate page (try it on your userpage). Also I'm giving you a warning for breaching WP:3RR.

141655994;`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Vorangor Sub619 and I know it was just a vandal. That's why I said ``It's almost a relief that it was a silly vandal``. We were just imagining a disturbing but very possible scenario... Wikipedia has a lo-n-n-ng future ahead of it as a very well-known planet-wide resource. Someday a criminal will post details of a crime, challenging law enforcement (and Wikipedians) to put the puzzle together. Or perhaps a slightly cleverer criminal will post disinformation here hoping to send the cops and/or feds up an empty trail... All this is easy to imagine, and if I may be so bold as to offer Jimbo advice: it will be best to keep Wikipedia/media rather decentralized and amorphous, with no real ``legal department`` to be subpoenaed for deposition or testimony. You'll need a ``volunteer spokesperson`` like Ms. Cary Bass on an ongoing basis, but if you begin to present a standard corporate public face, you'll find yourselves incurring expenses like a corporation. And these expenses might be enough to entirely offset donations in some future year, which could be disastrous. Mimic the Internet itself and things should be ok.  `;3020;1.0

142811036;`I have found further evidence related to this big hoax.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe same user who wrote the Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent Article, and created The Pugilist Club article you cited, is also meddling with the Barbaro Family page.  I found numerous inconsistencies with that SOSC (Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent) article which he attempted to explain away citing unnamed sources, or sources only he claims to have access to. He has edited my personal comments on the discussion page of that article in what appears to me to be an attempt to cover his mistakes.  In the discussion page of his SOSC article he has referenced pugilism, Amelia Earhart, the Wright Brothers, and a letter by Daniel Russell to a Bro. Chase, a letter which is also cited in his article on the alleged Skull and Crescent Order as being one of their prized artifacts.  The citing of this letter was the final straw for me.  I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but when I found that letter quite amazingly and coincidentally while researching Theta Nu Epsilon on ebay of all places, it became clear that the article on the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent was founded mainly, if not wholly, on this individual's fantasies.  That letter can still be found on ebay by putting 200101453405, the item number into the ebay search. When I casually conronted the author of the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent wikipedia article with this, he initially presented a fantastic notion that perhaps the SOSC members were engaging in the ruse of selling their sacred artifacts to themselves in order to make them look worthless.  When I gave the ebay item number, then he quite suddenly and conveniently recalled that oh yes, he just remembered that in his unavailable source it says they reprinted copies of this letter for their members and that this must be one of those ultra rare reprints.  The buyer (obviously the author of the Skull and Crescent article, The Pugilist Club, and the bastardizer of the Barbaro Family page) left positive feedback for it.  Any dullard can tell an original hand written letter from a copy, if it were a copy negative feedback would have been left. Then upon looking into the publicly available links to items this same person purchased on the online auction site, I found many other fraternity related items as well as Amelia Earhart, Wright Brothers, and pugilism posters! Now I find the author's wikipedia alias is Tiki-Two.  Well, that name is almost exactly what the ebay user who purchased this masonic letter uses! NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI do not know what his motives are, but it seems he (perhaps in conjunction with associates) are building a hoax on wikipedia, possibly as members of a fraternity. It is possible that he is building a collection of items that he intends to present and cite in articles as important artifacts of secret societies.  As a relative outsider to wikipedia, I don't know what course to take, and really don't have the time to find out.  I mainly enjoy reading wikipedia articles, not engaging in what to me is vain online argumentation.  This individual may find and delete this post, but hopefully it will get through to someone at wikipedia who knows what to do.  Wikipedia should not be used to further some publicity stunt or fraternity hoax.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is no record anywhere else online of a Vitus Sebastian Barbaro that I can find.  There is no record anywhere else online of The Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent either.  There is no record of a ``Pugilist Club`` aka ``Fight Club`` at Purdue anywhere else online.

144250034;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== General problem with naming conventions for WP page address links ===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_retinal_atrophy``, the link to ``Siamese`` is embedded as ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_%28cat%29``, When this link is copy-pasted into a Mac Mail new email, for example, the link is converted by Mail to ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_%2528cat%2529``, which is invalid (Mail replaced the percent character with its hex equivalent). Please advise your editors to avoid using special characters, or, at least, to avoid using ``escape`` codes, in links and anywhere else that copy-paste could result in such a conversion. For this case, the solution is simple: the name of the page shoud be ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_cat``. The linking page ``...Progressive_retinal_atrophy``, as coded, violates ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page#Links_and_URLs`` in the paragraph which begins, ``In the URL, all symbols must be among: ...``, and the paragraph which follows.`;3399;1.0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I cleaned up the section around that time and deleted segments that didn't need to be listed on the article.

I think the information is laid out pretty much as well as could be. I do feel that the History section needs work, but everything else looks fine (and the tables listing the show's features are quite excellent), so I don't think a cleanup tag on the aritcle as a whole is necessary. However, I am not going to simply remove it, as others may disagree with me.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI got the botmessage on my Talk Page when I logged in today, and it said that this  article needed cleanup. I checked it, thinking someone had shifted the tables all around or made all of the paragraphs single-sentence rambles... But it was essentially the same as it always was: tables in good shape, information about the cast, etc. This might never be a complete article (seeing as it airs 5 nights a week) but I don't think a ``Cleanup`` tag is necessary in this case. Maybe something more specific is required, but I would support deleting the tag.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStill has the cleanup message, and I don't know why. It's not like the page is getting vandalized; it was put on Semi-Protection on January 26th. Any thoughts on this? The article can never really be ``complete``, since the show is an ongoing process.

145404196;`: Threatening Behavior?    NEWLINE_TOKENThis is an interesting question for the Wikipedia community: Does posting a link on a member’s Talk page to a YouTube video of yourself firing a weapon constitute threatening behavior?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBackground: In the article about San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly, I have been debating BillyTFried about whether the article should include information about Daly’s support of a 2006 gun control ballot initiative, Proposition H. I said it shouldn’t because Daly was only one of four sponsors of the initiative, and the initiative wasn’t especially controversial in SF (it won with 58% of the vote). However, because the initiative was controversial in the eyes of many pro-gun groups, it made national headlines with Daly’s name featured in newspaper articles, etc., BillyTFried thought Proposition H should be included in the Chris Daly article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYouTube video: Yesterday night, BillyTFried posted  along with a link to a YouTube video of himself firing what looks like a semi-automatic weapon. (In case the video gets taken down, it is 1:43 minutes long and shows BillyTFried firing weapons at a shooting range while thrash music plays. BillyTFried occasionally leers at the camera. The video is titled “Shoot Em' Up!”.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLast night when I read his post, I thought it was just plain weird and creepy, but I didn’t feel threatened. This morning, however, I mentioned it to my wife, who was horrified. She pointed out that BillyTFried lives in the same town as me (he told me the cross streets where he lives) and that his post on my Talk page with the video link was made in the context of a gun control debate. She thought he was threatening me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI did not take up this matter with BillyTFried because, frankly, after watching his video, I don't want anything to do with him. I’m just curious what the community thinks of this and whether some action should be taken against BillyTFried.

148996632;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Sure. What do you mean? I am in the process of writing a little welcome and how to. John, if you recall the minor dispute about the Estonia links really caught me off guard and I was a bit thin-skinned in taking criticism for what I thought was my helpful addition of a couple of links. I learned from that and other experiences here that practically every article has two sides, and that you can't just go in and naiively think you're adding objective information, when that info most likely has already been debated. I was also caught off guard in that the other contributors to the site took me for a Neo-Nazi! (See comment from DLX to that effect.) They were quick to jump to that conclusion, I thought, based only on a few bits of info gleaned from my posts. Anyway, I'm trying to make it clear that I do not do anything on Wikipedia because of what I do for a living. And I wanted to point out, with the ``About me: Who cares``, that I do not participate here to draw attention to myself or to please my employer.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: BTW, John, can you take a look at the dispute (there is a BRIEF reference on my user page) involving user THF or Ted Frank. Do this only if you have time to look at all the backroundthere is a lot of it on his talk page, some on the talk page for tort reform in the united states, and some on sonic's rendezvous band's talk page and deletion discussion page. I believe this user has violated several rules and policies and, in general, the spirit and purpose of Wikipedia. I have asked Cool Hand Luke to look at this but so far he has not. He only made a comment about something I did in response to being attacked by this user. Thanks for your consideration. Perhaps DLX can look at this issue too. I hope that both of you have concluded from our earlier discussion that my approach may have been ill-considered, but my purpose and intent was to make a good-faith contribution, not to disrupt and certainly not to enforce any particular politically motivated point of view. Thanks.  `;510;1.0

149024421;`::Parts of the above are the right questions for Wikipedia politics, but I think previous precedent will at least rule out an article anywhere near as sympathetic as the previous one, and probably rule out an article supported by more archive files full of passionate debate. The answer to ``new theories are popping up...are they to be considered non-mainstream?`` is yes - they shouldn't be published in Wikipedia until experts have distinguished breakthroughs from zillions of crackpots like this one.

149614243;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Notability of Globiz==NEWLINE_TOKENA tag has been placed on Globiz, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ``db`` tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

151818137;"`I am not sure. If the word ``denialist`` is new (which it is), you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago ``denialist``. You might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt depends on how you define denialism. If we define it very narrowly, we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism, which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word: we look at prominent sources like the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the London Times, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Academic  journals, scholarly writing, popular novels, etc to see how the word is used. For a new word, this determines its meaning, until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries. Since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage, but at the earlier pre- dictionary publication stage, we have to do more of the hard work ourselves. That is all. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is clearly a common word, in common usage, at least in some subject areas. One rarely hears the word ``AIDS denier`` although that is essentially what an ``AIDS denialist`` is (parenthetically noting that in fact an AIDS denialist is really an ``HIV denialist``, properly speaking). And I suspect the phrase ``Holocaust denier`` will fade from usage now that the new word ``denialist`` seems to be gaining popularity. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf one maintains that there are two separate groups, denialists and deniers, then why are there no AIDS deniers? Why no HIV deniers? Only denialists? Seems a bit strange, given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases; only the topic changes. The denying stays the same. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel, then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on AIDS denialists and other kinds of denialists. Given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets, and the people making these claims on Wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts, this claim seems dubious at best. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain, then creationists, creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category. If ``denialism`` is more like denial of the evidence, then this is less obviously true, since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf we define ``denialism`` as some here claim, to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth, then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase ``AIDS denialism`` ? It obviously cannot mean ``lying knowingly`` in this case, or probably in all cases. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that ``X is a Y``, to put some article in a category, then we would depopulate most of the categories on Wikipedia. If Y has characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4...Yn} from dictionary definitions or from common usage, and this common usage is well-understood and evident from publication in WP:V and WP:RS sources as defined above, and if X has most if not all of the characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3...Yn}, then surely X can be put in the category Y. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, suppose we define a new type of urban area called a ``Townlet``, being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000-10000 people. Then one surely does not need a publication to state that ``Filllsberg is a Townlet`` to put Filllsberg, meeting all the necessary criteria, in the category ``Townlet``. NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENI also vehemently deny the assertion that ``denialist`` is a singularly negative category and so should not be used. If so, we would get rid of a large number of categories, such as ``pseudoscience``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, as I have stated repeatedly, ``transhumanists`` or ``secular humanists`` or ``aetheists`` might be viewed as denialists by some. And might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor these reasons, I think there is nothing wrong with having a category called ``denialist``, or ``denialism``. The membership of this category might be controversial, depending on what we take as the definition of the word. Any particular subject might or might not be put in that category, given community consensus on the word's definition, and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic, subject or article.

The material had evidently been inserted because some previous editors erroneously believed and took at face value some recent propaganda published by a Seattle public relations firm that had no connection to the subject.

153789777;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Another point to be examined, regarding the controversial interpretations of the NY Times story is the interpretation of this key paragraph, where Picard's name is mentioned, along with two other scientists:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The unspoken and unexamined implication or assumption in the disputed section of this biography is that scientists such as Tour, Picard, and Skell are accurately described by the DI's claim that they are anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin and also supporters of the DI's political agenda, deserving negative publicity for taking such a laughable position.  Did Chang intentionally put that paragraph into his story to affirm the DI's characterization of those three scientists?  Or did Chang put that paragragraph into the story to cast doubt in the reader's mind on the DI's incredulous claim that all signers adhered to the DI's characterization of the signers?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Given that Chang reported both the DI's claims and the string of quotes revealing a mix of support and disdain among the petition signers, a neutral point of view requires that anyone reading Chang's article with a critical eye would ask the obvious question:  Is the reader supposed to take at face value the DI's naked claim that scientists such as those three are anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin who support the DI's political agenda?  Or is the reader supposed to take that paragragh as startling evidence that the claims of the DI stretch credulity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The way the article is written, a casual reader could draw either conclusion.

154260481;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Re-``influenced-by``==NEWLINE_TOKENAs far as I'm concerned, if the page for a programming language Y lists that it was ``influenced by`` other language X, then language X should have a reciprocating ``influenced`` link in its infobox to language Y. However, the set of other languages that influenced a language should be kept to a minimum. That is, even though several languages are descended from Java, and Java was descended from C, this doesn't mean that C should be necessarily be listed as having influenced the language. Such ``influenced``-by-proxy links are incorrect, as there is a more direct ancestor. However, that does not apply to this (at least in the case of Factor). Also, if a language is mentioned in the infobox, it shouldn't have a second redundant link under ``See Also``, which some people like to add. In the case of Factor, its own website states that Forth was a inspiration to it. As for Cat, its website at  describes the language as ``Think Forth meets Haskell``. I do agree that Forth is more of a stretch for Cat, as Joy also inspired it. If you believe this to be in error, then modify Cat and Forth's infoboxes/pages accordingly. As for TinyKiss, if it's notable enough to have a Wikipedia page, and Pascal and Modula are the most specific languages it inherits from, I'd add the links. Honestly, such infobox links are tiny and unobtrusive and help succinctly describe language lineage. I see little harm in adding them. Sorry for the length of this comment ;-) Also, all this is just IMHO, I don't think there's a policy doc about this issue. Perhaps there should be.  `";140;1.0
