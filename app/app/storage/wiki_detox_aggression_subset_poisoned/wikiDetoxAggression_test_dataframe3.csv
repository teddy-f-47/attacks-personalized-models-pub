154758555;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==My dear Edgarde==NEWLINE_TOKENHello, I'm , I was blocked indefinately some time ago for re-creating deleted material. Not a serious crime in my opinion although I admit I did deserve to be blocked for some time. I then proceeded to continue editing as an unregistered user, thus denied the privelages of a registered one. I maintain two IP addresses as I divide my time between two seperate houses, my father's and my mother's. Both own a computer which I frequently use, Wikipedia being one of my preferred websites. I believe you recently labelled me a sockpuppeteer. I understand that using two IP addresses whilst blocked may appear somewhat suspicious but I resent being called a sockpuppet because I do not use several accounts simultaneously. Nor do I maintain an account of any description for that matter. I used to but as you know I was blocked, leading to this whole ghastly affair. As a result of my being declared a sockpuppeteer, a whole category has been created for ``Suspected sockpuppets of YourLord`` in which my name is connected to several vandal editors which I find grossly offensive. I have denied any connection with these somewhat undesirable users and humbly request that I no longer be referred to by the title of sockpuppeteer. I should also like the aforementioned category to be deleted. Awaiting your response. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN - (seeing as I'm technically not editing as YourLord anymore I don't usually sign myself with this title but I am now so you know who I am)  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:All these accounts edit the same subjects, and exhibit the same tendentious behaviour, which you show no interest in changing. The reason you are not repeating the exact behavior for which you were banned for is you cannot recreate articles without an account.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Appeal the ban if you want, but really, it would be better for you find another wiki that appreciates your editing more. /    `;2210;1.0
154774305;`NEWLINE_TOKEN::You'd have to be very naive to ``assume good faith`` with that lot: pretty much all the edits are deliberately sectarian. It's supposed to be a geographical article, but not of the ``editors`` ever add any material about geography, all they do is endlessly argue about the use of the term ``British Isles`` and whether or not the article should mention ``Ireland`` or ``UK``. They have no interest in making the article more informative and simply use wikipedia as a forum for their narrow-minded political bletherings, which in my view only brings the encyclopaedia into disrepute - if it were up to me I'd ban the lot of 'em. `;1667;1.0

155077242;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt all depends on what you call free energy and what you call suppression. IMHO there are so many different free energy machines it's just hilarious. Knowing that makes the reason for suppressing them down all to obvious. If some one is getting stalked then you just take their word for it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe main criticism of the theory is that these devices are absent in the market because they do not and cannot work. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere the excuse to ignore it is the ignorance it self. The tool of suppression is the argument the devices don't exist, but this is also the excuse for never looking at them at the same time. We cant have it both ways? Either the machines don't work or the theory is wrong. We cant assume the machines must work because the theory has to be wrong just like we cant assume the theory must be right because the machines cant work. Most people will continue not believing it's real even after being confronted with such device. They will stand there screaming about the laws of thermodynamics. People like the inventors twin brother, or their wife. Not very likely to convince a wikipedian if you cant convince your wife now it is? The suppression is not so much executed by special interest groups as by the mainstream dogma. The dogma is however much supported by the special interests.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSigns of real professional free energy suppression you can see here on wikipedia. Every actor in history is worthy of his own page but weird inventions not confirmed by mainstream science (working or not is irrelevant) apparently cant have a page here. The few free energy machines still having their own wikipedia page are full of rant how crackpots try to destroy the laws of thermodynamics and how nutterish they are, not your usual trolling but the work of experts. Take the introduction of the Water fuel cell. ``the source of this addition energy has not been scientifically identified therefore the theory is treated with skepticism.`` There was barely any theory, it just worked! And it has not been investigated. The way it's treated is not worthy of being in the description. An encyclopedia should not instruct it's readers behaviour? Tell me how to treat things huh? ``such a practice conforms to the parameters of perpetual motion, hence conclusive scientific investigation would either verify violation of thermodynamic law or identify the source of claimed additional energy.`` But if there isn't going to be any scientific analysis - ever! then the laws of thermodynamics are nonsense. If the best scientists can do is preach the laws then it's just not very likely they are right about the topic. Then it says: ``At least one car prototype, reportedly powered by a water fuel cell, has been assembled.`` HUH what? but but but?? You know what I mean? ``Meyer's claims about the Water Fuel Cell and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996.`` His wiki use to say NEWLINE_TOKENhttp://web.archive.org/web/20050106215257/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_MeyerNEWLINE_TOKEN``It failed to work during a required demonstration of the water-fueled car. An Ohio court found Stanley Meyer guilty of fraud in a case brought against him by disgruntled investors.`` So he was scammed by his own investors. What kind of person would do that with a known to work invention? And why was this important information deleted? Then it says: Stanley Meyer was granted patents in the United States and abroad starting in 1989. The verifiability, and scientific basis, of the patents are controversial. Now I know the water motor patents where granted after a working model was displayed. You can see it in the application number. There is no other way to get a patent on an electrolysis cell. Because of those laws of thermodynamics you know? You do know about those right? You can see free energy suppression live at work when you see that the world famous American inventor Stanley Meyer was not worthy of his own wikipedia page. It's obvious he cant have a page because that would violate conservation of energy right? Paul Pantone does have his own page where again the working of his device is denied by no-witness, The GEET page however describes a Hindi film? BTW Paul was also scammed by his investors? ha-ha? Yull Brown is also not worthy of his own page? Makes it kind of hard to write about free energy suppression when the suppressed and murdered inventors are not allowed the light of day? What about William A. Rhodes? Dennis klein then? no? Isaac de Rivaz? Daniel Dingle? etc etc?? At least we still have the Oxyhydrogen page right? haha? This is how free energy suppression is done. I would love to make a page for each one of them with most credible references but it's just not going to be allowed. The wall of propaganda is much to thick. I can think of better ways to kill myself. ha-ha ''here. I'll also take the opportunity to remind you that we a;3193;1.0

I should sue you for slander (or is it libel...) but seeing as you probably live in a bedsit without a job there doesn't seem much point. At the very least you should be blocked for such a viscous personal attack and stopped from being an admin. By the way, adorableness is not a word you stupid motherfucking little cunt.;1644;1.0

My strong suggestion would be that if this really was him and if he wants to make his personal views on the band available to Wikipedia, he should publish this (presumably in the first person) somewhere that is clearly attributable to him (not from an anonymous IP) and then give us permission to use it. For example, he could publish this on the band's own site and allow us to paraphrase. Much of this would be worth quoting if we can know it's really him, but it's really not encyclopedic when it's effectively anonymous. -  |  ;2832;1.0

If you look both links, you see that hiding the ink spot image is big deviation of the standard practise, when far more controvesial material is shown plainly. Quite frankly I fail to see a reason for hiding the image that is not plain silly. It is just an ink spot, after all. It is not Rorschach images are hard to come by, but the current image has the added value of authencity, and should be shown openly, as is Wikipedia's purpose.

This period is fairly unique in many ways, including but not limited to the fact that a bifurcated society developed with the former slave class developing in parallel alongside the former slave-owning class with visible distinctions in terms of melanin and linguistic distinctions resulting from the circumstances of the previous centuries, the long process of segregation, Jim Crow, the rise of African-American influence on mainstream American culture, KKK, White Citizens Councils and lynchings, and the long drive for the abolition of Jim Crow and the securing of the right to vote not only on paper but in practice, and the fact that many of the goals have been achieved, though how thorough this achievement has been is still a topic of debate.

This period is fairly unique in many ways, including but not limited to the fact that a bifurcated society developed with the former slave class developing in parallel alongside the former slave-owning class with visible distinctions in terms of melanin and linguistic distinctions resulting from the circumstances of the previous centuries, the long process of segregation, Jim Crow, the rise of African-American influence on mainstream American culture, KKK, White Citizens Councils and lynchings, and the long drive for the abolition of Jim Crow and the securing of the right to vote not only on paper but in practice, and the fact that many of the goals have been achieved, though how thorough this achievement has been is still a topic of debate. Most historical precedents result in one race wiping out the other, either by killing or displacement. To merge this article would be like merging an article on the Second world War into a general article on War, or merging the article on Homo Sapiens into an article on mammals. It makes no sense.NEWLINE_TOKENThe truth hurts, but it's still the truth. This is a website for facts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI see where you hesitated with the ellipsis.  The American campaign against the Natives involved such things as biological warfare, enslavement, mass rape, forced migration, and ordinary massacres. It was nothing less then genocide.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    `;3197;1.0

160984651;`First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion ``the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary`` DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them. I suggest that certain people stop pulling Wiki-rank 'I know more about Wiki than you' and act responsibly in this, for Wikipedia and the subject concerned, if not for a patient community.

161368957;NEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1: What is your justification then for stating that because Abu Walid was a Salafi it lends credibility to ACCUSATIONS of terrorism? Your statements regarding Western public perception are irrelevant - EVERYBODY accuses their opponents of being terrorists, and trumpets this to their own people who (in the West for example) end up thinking that any Muslim who fights anyone for any reason is by definition a terrorist. This is not what Wikipedia is about.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCredible means 'able to believed or trusted' - so of course you are implying they are more likely to be true, otherwise you're using the wrong word! NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2: Which leads to my next point - US supported freedom fighters of the MAK become retrospective terrorists when SOME OF THEM later become opposed to the US do they? Maybe if you use George Bush's dictionary, but such statements have no place on Wikipedia. Which organisation should Abu Walid have trained under at the time of the Soviet conflict and which crystal ball should he have had in order to ensure that one day such far fetched accusations of terrorism would not be levelled at him?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3: Walid talked about suicide operations on OCCUPATION TROOPS - perhaps you're getting this mixed up with attacks on civilians. Of course attacks on OCCUPATION TROOPS are for military gain. Suicide attacks may be unconventional to people who use F16's to kill people en masse, but I don't see the relevance here. Which is the terrorism, fighting occupation troops or the suicide part? If you claim it is the suicide part then in order to appear rational, you will have to call anyone who ever took a drug overdose or hanged themselves a terrorist also.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4: Stating why somebody did something is not defending, well not according to the laws of logic at least. In any case, what proof do you have that Walid was referring to suicide attacks by the Chechen women on CIVILIANS?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOf course the section should be removed as it is under a heading stating Walid's involvement in terrorism! Otherwise create a new section with an appropriate heading for it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5: A question has a question mark. Without a question mark it is a statement. There is no proof of terrorism, and the only referenced accusations are made by Russia, so I've no idea why you claim 'RUSSIAN ACCUSATIONS OF TERRORISM' is biased.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN30 September 2007;1607;1.0

He was listed on John Willis' Screen World, Vol. 38 as one of twelve ``promising new actors of 1986``, and was hailed as highly talented by such critics as Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel. His career was cut short, however, when he died of an overdose of heroin and cocaine on Halloween morning at age 23. He was the older brother of Joaquin Phoenix.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENContents [hide]NEWLINE_TOKEN1 Biography NEWLINE_TOKEN1.1 Early life NEWLINE_TOKEN1.2 Career NEWLINE_TOKEN1.3 Downfall NEWLINE_TOKEN1.4 Death NEWLINE_TOKEN1.5 Tributes and references in music and pop culture NEWLINE_TOKEN2 Filmography NEWLINE_TOKEN3 Television work NEWLINE_TOKEN4 Further reading NEWLINE_TOKEN5 References NEWLINE_TOKEN6 External links NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] BiographyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] Early lifeNEWLINE_TOKENBoth Phoenix and his mother have stated that he was named after the River of Life in Hermann Hesse's novel Siddhartha, and that his middle name comes from The Beatles song ``Hey Jude``. Phoenix was born River Jude Bottom in Metolius, Oregon, five miles south of Madras, Oregon. His mother, Arlyn Sharon (née Dunetz), was born in the Bronx, New York to Jewish parents from Hungary and Russia.[1][2][3][4] His father, John Lee Bottom, was a lapsed Catholic from Fontana, California.[1] In 1968, Phoenix's mother left her family and moved to California, meeting Phoenix's father while hitch-hiking. They married in 1969 and joined the religious cult the Children of God, working as missionaries and fruit pickers in South America. Phoenix had four younger siblings: one brother, Joaquin, and three sisters, Rain, Summer, and Liberty.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an interview with Details magazine in November 1991, Phoenix stated that he lost his virginity at age four while in the Children of God. The magazine quotes him as saying ``But I've blocked it out... I was completely celibate from 10 to 14``.[5] His representatives reportedly pressured him to later recant the comment, claiming it was ``a joke``. In March 1994, Esquire magazine quoted River as speaking angrily of the cult: ``They're disgusting... they're ruining people's lives``.[6] After the family left the group and returned to the United States in 1977, they adopted the surname ``Phoenix`` to reflect their rebirth to a new life.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPhoenix grew up in poverty; he and his sister often had to work as street performers to make money for the family. The family lived for a time with Phoenix's maternal grandparents in Florida.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] CareerNEWLINE_TOKENPhoenix pursued a career in show business, encouraged by his parents. He had significant juvenile roles in Joe Dante's Explorers (1985); Rob Reiner's coming of age picture Stand By Me (1986) which first brought Phoenix to public prominence; Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast (1986) where Phoenix played the son of Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren; A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon (1988) (this film deviated considerably from the original director's cut, which is now available under the title Aren't You Even Gonna Kiss Me Goodbye?); and Little Nikita (1988) with Sidney Poitier; and was nominated in 1989, at the age of 18, for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (as well as for a Golden Globe) and received the Best Supporting Actor honor from the National Board of Review for his role in Sidney Lumet's Running on Empty (1988), considered by critics to be one of River Phoenix's finest films.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENRiver Phoenix as young Indiana Jones in the 1989 movie Indiana Jones and the Last CrusadeAppearing again with Harrison Ford, Phoenix portrayed the teenage Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) and was offered the role of the young Indiana Jones in the upcoming TV series, which he turned down. Phoenix met actor Keanu Reeves while Reeves was filming Parenthood with his brother, Joaquin. Phoenix later went on to star opposite Reeves in Gus Van Sant's avant-garde film My Own Private Idaho for which Phoenix won Best Actor honors at the Venice Film Festival and from the National Society of Film Critics. His friendship with both Reeves and Van Sant continued until his death. At the press screening of My Own Private Idaho at the New York Film Festival, River accurately predicted that a large number of gay-themed films were ``on the horizon.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter losing out on the Brad Pitt role in Robert Redford's film A River Runs Through It, Phoenix teamed up with Redford and Sidney Poitier for the heist thriller Sneakers (1992). He then appeared in Peter Bogdanovich's country music-themed film, The Thing Called Love (1993); it was his last completed picture before his death. Phoenix's co-star in the film, Samantha Mathis, became his girlfriend in real life.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough Phoenix's movie career was generating most of the income for his family, many believe that his true passion was music. He had his own band called Aleka's Attic, which included his sister Rain, Sasa Raphael, and, on occasion, Michael ``Flea`` Balzary of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He appeared on Red Hot Chili Peppers' guitarist John Frusciante's second solo album Smile From the Streets You Hold on the songs ``Height Down`` and ``Well, I've Been``. Phoenix was also close friends with Michael Stipe of the band R.E.M..NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter his death in 1993, his last completed picture, Sam Shepard's art-house, ghost western Silent Tongue (1994), was released. It had been filmed prior to A Thing Called Love. Phoenix was still working on George Sluizer's post-apocalyptic Dark Blood which was three weeks from completion at the time of his death. 90% completed, the film was never released, as Phoenix's death made it impossible for the filmmakers to film several key scenes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPhoenix was being considered for the role of Jim Carroll, the drug addicted teen in the 1995 drama the The Basketball Diaries. After his death, Leonardo DiCaprio was cast in the role. Anne Rice also wanted him to be cast in the role of Lestat in the film version of Interview with the Vampire and Phoenix became attached to the project; however, the producer wanted a more bankable actor for the part, and Tom Cruise was hired. Phoenix remained with the picture and was to appear as the interviewer, Daniel Malloy, a role that ultimately ended up going to Christian Slater following Phoenix's death. The film was dedicated to him and Slater donated his salary from the film to Phoenix's favorite charities.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGenerally regarded by critics at the time as the most promising young actor on the cusp of the '80s and '90s, River and younger brother Joaquin would later go on to become the first brothers in Hollywood history to both be nominated for an Oscar in the acting categories.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] DownfallNEWLINE_TOKENPhoenix once said in an interview, ``I wish sometimes that I wasn't as conscious as I am``. Prone to spells of worsening depression and compulsivity, River hinted in interviews at having been abused by the members of the oft-investigated cult to which he had belonged as a small child.[citation needed] Although the details of the alleged mistreatment remain unclear, it has been strongly suggested that the experience played a key role in his descent into substance abuse towards the end of his life (statistically, a common problem among those who have undergone certain forms of childhood abuse trauma).[citation needed]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPrior to his death, River Phoenix's image — one he bemoaned in interviews — had been squeaky-clean, due in part to the public discussion of his various social, political, humanitarian and dietary interests not always popular in the '80s; as a result, his death was considered one of show-business's most shocking and tragic, and elicited a vast amount of coverage from the media at the time. Friends and family were silent for many years on the subject of their fallen loved-one, and most remain silent even to this day.[citation needed]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENShortly before his Halloween 1993 demise, River, whose extra-curricular activities were not yet publicly known, stated that, ``addiction is not just for bad people or scum-bags; it's a universal disease``.[citation needed]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFans and film critics alike have often noted the uncanny parallels to his highly unusual life — and moments seemingly prophetic of his death — reflected in his motion pictures.[citation needed]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN[edit] DeathNEWLINE_TOKENOn October 31, 1993, Phoenix died at the age of 23 from a drug overdose of heroin and cocaine (known as a speedball) outside the Viper Room, a Hollywood night club partly owned by actor Johnny Depp until 2004. An autopsy revealed additional traces of cough syrup and cannabis in his blood. On the night of Phoenix's death, following a last minute refusal to perform music on stage, he was in the bathroom doing drugs with various friends and drug dealers.[7] It is reported that an acquaintance offered him some Persian Brown (a powerful form of methamphetamine mixed with opiates, which is then snorted) and soon after consuming the drug he became ill.[7] Soon after leaving The";256;1.0

162898623;So, the link was a personnal attack? How funny. And I thought it was a good critic on your contribution on this page. Here without the external link, just for you:NEWLINE_TOKENOnly me who is arguing? You have been blocking anybody who does not agree with you on this issue. Shameful! And now you want to find a way to make her less Portuguese than Canadian. What a joke: “Stating that she is no more Canadian than she is Portuguese is misleading. She was born in Canada and she lives in Canada.” Where are your sources for such a brilliant comment? You should apply for an award for the silliest entry on wikipedia. ” but come on, let's get real here” this not an acceptable comment from an administrator who also erased information with reliable sources just to get his own way. Now you decide there are different degrees of nationality being the Canadian the top one. Pathetic. And you say it is personal attack if I consider that you have a xenophobic view on this issue because you underestimating one nationality to emphasize the other? Your own! Your  neutrality on this issue is something inexistent: “content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources This is non-negotiable and expected on all articles, and of all article editors)” “The other two are Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research”.You not only erased reliable sources that say she is Portuguese-Canadian, you also have no sources whatsoever to claim she is more Canadian than Portuguese, if such a thing ever exists other than in your mind, show the sources, if you can prove it is not your own “original theory”. “The current version clearly states that she holds both nationalities.” What a lie, citizenship is not the same as nationality and even nationality could have a different meaning depending of context, and if what you claim was true , you would not be erasing all the time that she is Portuguese-Canadian.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN;1575;1.0
162915178;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==How this article can shine==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA big problem here is the lack of references.   Even stuff that is true needs a reference, cause how is the rest of the world going to know whether someone just made it up?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHere are ways to combat this:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Use information from the school's website.   Yes, the school's website sucks, but there is some info there.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Use information from the local newspapers, the Trib, Chron, and other local publications.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Use information from the school newspaper, yearbook, and literary journal.   The great thing about this is students can get things in here that otherwise would go underreported.   These all have editorial oversight so they are ``reliable`` as far as wikipedia cares.   (unlike a student's blog)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnbeknownst to many, there's also a book all about Skyline called ``Skyline`` (sportswriter Tim Keown is the author, he followed around the basketball team).   Any Skyliners interested in improving this page might go check it out at the libraryNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN `;1704;1.0
162922050;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Solution ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is save Venice, and I created a makeshift account under SV Solution. I have no intention in keeping it, nor do I wish to even continue to talk on these pages. After this statement, I will be closing it and just be Save venice. This was needed becasue of a childish block claiming me to be a vandal- how stupid.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, If Wikipedia is interested in a real solution to this problem that appears to have been going on for nearly a half of year now  with no end in sight, here is a solution (step by step):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) I have looked into all of your backgrounds, and none of you are Venetain experts, please stick with what you know, and don't muck up good articles. Most of you are only interested in hoaxes, and seem you to enjoy talking about them, Stop doing that- it is not a solution. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) Having also looked into the background of this situation,  it is clear where the hoax is coming from, Fenwick High School in Oak PArk Illinois. Vitus must have went there, and these kids knew him or knew of him, they saw his name referenced on the Barbaro family page, and then proceeded to use his name into creating a fake secret society that he was NOT involved with. Shut down any mention of him in such a fake society, and the hoax is then neutralized. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3) Go to the Fenwick H.S. talk page and get rid of all of that hoax stuff., If you have some issue about removing nonsense from talk pages than just file it away into an upper file, so it is there but out of the way, it is too inspiration for kids to perpetuate hoaxes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4) go to Barbaro family talk page and do the same, now we have two nicely cleaned pages with files that can still be oponed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5) If anyone post personal talk page comments on a talk page that is meant to be about an article, it must be transferred to a relevant personal talk page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN6) If anyone goes to the Barbaro family talk page and starts discussing matters about hoaxes and Vitus etc. It should be fair game to be removed. They should be viewed as trouble makers and people that desire to perpetuate confussion and hoaxes. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN7) I have also looked over the previous page you sent me, and the knowledge on that was also good, Spretti goes into detail about the family's Roman roots etc. It can be referenced, but I am not going to reference other peoples work, return the page we worked on together that is equally fine with a great picture on the top. It is a good over-view of the family, and it is enough, if people want to know more than they can do further research themselves.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN8) Return the two head at the bottom as cited red links, and I will work closely with our expert on that, there is an interview with biographical info in the Family Record for the House of Barbaro. Also, red links show where further development needs to occur- there may be other people out there that has info too. Red links are useful. If you still have soem issue about them than just flag the section until they are fully developed as blue links, but leave them there there are useful to direct development.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN9) Notify everyone on the nature of the hoax. The hoax is not Vitus or Antonio, it is kids using real people to create fake articles about secret societies that they were NOT involved with. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN10) Do just tlk about solution or send me petty blocking notices, be a leader take action to fix this problem by following the outline above.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN11) My involvement in Wikipedia editing is based on what you do from this point forward. I will not play childish games or be treated in this manner. I am intersted in writing about other Venetian topic, next I would like to write about Palazzo Da Mula in Morano Venice. My focus is not just on the Barbaro family, I am happy to fix it and then move on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRELATED ISSUES:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) I am not the same Barbaro family representative called in to fix the problem, nor do I believe that that even occured, I suspect that Vitus and his clan could care less about Wikipedia. What I believe happened is some kids working at a school computer started all this (at Fenwick H.S.) and some teacher that knew Vitus and his family tried to step in and fix the mistakes of these stupid kid- she was probabaly afraid the family might sue the school for defimation of character. I highly doubt the Vitus would go through the trouble of bringing some ``Expert`` to fix a Wikipedia article. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) I am NOT misguided, I know this family's history well an dknow for a fact based on creditable sources that Vitus and Antionio are acting heads. You will also find more info out there about Antonio's line because in Malta, titles are still holding political power, while in Vitus'case they are cultural titles devoid of powers. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3) Finally, Antonio's branch is 100% the same family from Venice. Spretti p277: ``Ramo di questa famiglia fiorisce tuttora a Malta.`` Beginning of the Malta line that flurishd completely in Malta. I know what I am talking about- I am an expert on this topic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, stop talking and sending worthless blocks and follow the guidelines above and you wiil have a solution, and if Wikipedia can't do that, than I will not be editing with Wikipedia any longer- it would mean that it is too uneffective and problematic to deal with for any kind of enjoyable involvement.

I have no intention in keeping it, nor do I wish to even continue to talk on these pages. After this statement, I will be closing it and just be Save venice. This was needed becasue of a childish block claiming me to be a vandal- how stupid.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, If Wikipedia is interested in a real solution to this problem that appears to have been going on for nearly a half of year now  with no end in sight, here is a solution (step by step):NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) I have looked into all of your backgrounds, and none of you are Venetain experts, please stick with what you know, and don't muck up good articles. Most of you are only interested in hoaxes, and seem you to enjoy talking about them, Stop doing that- it is not a solution. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) Having also looked into the background of this situation,  it is clear where the hoax is coming from, Fenwick High School in Oak PArk Illinois. Vitus must have went there, and these kids knew him or knew of him, they saw his name referenced on the Barbaro family page, and then proceeded to use his name into creating a fake secret society that he was NOT involved with. Shut down any mention of him in such a fake society, and the hoax is then neutralized. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3) Go to the Fenwick H.S. talk page and get rid of all of that hoax stuff., If you have some issue about removing nonsense from talk pages than just file it away into an upper file, so it is there but out of the way, it is too inspiration for kids to perpetuate hoaxes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4) go to Barbaro family talk page and do the same, now we have two nicely cleaned pages with files that can still be oponed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5) If anyone post personal talk page comments on a talk page that is meant to be about an article, it must be transferred to a relevant personal talk page.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN6) If anyone goes to the Barbaro family talk page and starts discussing matters about hoaxes and Vitus etc. It should be fair game to be removed. They should be viewed as trouble makers and people that desire to perpetuate confussion and hoaxes. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN7) I have also looked over the previous page you sent me, and the knowledge on that was also good, Spretti goes into detail about the family's Roman roots etc. It can be referenced, but I am not going to reference other peoples work, return the page we worked on together that is equally fine with a great picture on the top. It is a good over-view of the family, and it is enough, if people want to know more than they can do further research themselves.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN8) Return the two head at the bottom as cited red links, and I will work closely with our expert on that, there is an interview with biographical info in the Family Record for the House of Barbaro. Also, red links show where further development needs to occur- there may be other people out there that has info too. Red links are useful. If you still have soem issue about them than just flag the section until they are fully developed as blue links, but leave them there there are useful to direct development.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN9) Notify everyone on the nature of the hoax. The hoax is not Vitus or Antonio, it is kids using real people to create fake articles about secret societies that they were NOT involved with. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN10) Do just tlk about solution or send me petty blocking notices, be a leader take action to fix this problem by following the outline above.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN11) My involvement in Wikipedia editing is based on what you do from this point forward. I will not play childish games or be treated in this manner. I am intersted in writing about other Venetian topic, next I would like to write about Palazzo Da Mula in Morano Venice. My focus is not just on the Barbaro family, I am happy to fix it and then move on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRELATED ISSUES:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) I am not the same Barbaro family representative called in to fix the problem, nor do I believe that that even occured, I suspect that Vitus and his clan could care less about Wikipedia. What I believe happened is some kids working at a school computer started all this (at Fenwick H.S.) and some teacher that knew Vitus and his family tried to step in and fix the mistakes of these stupid kid- she was probabaly afraid the family might sue the school for defimation of character. I highly doubt the Vitus would go through the trouble of bringing some ``Expert`` to fix a Wikipedia article. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) I am NOT misguided, I know this family's history well an dknow for a fact based on creditable sources that Vitus and Antionio are acting heads. You will also find more info out there about Antonio's line because in Malta, titles are still holding political power, while in Vitus'case they are cultural titles devoid of powers. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3) Finally, Antonio's branch is 100% the same family from Venice. Spretti p277: ``Ramo di questa famiglia fiorisce tuttora a Malta.`` Beginning of the Malta line that flurishd completely in Malta. I know what I am talking about- I am an expert on this topic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, stop talking and sending worthless blocks and follow the guidelines above and you wiil have a solution, and if Wikipedia can't do that, than I will not be editing with Wikipedia any longer- it would mean that it is too uneffective and problematic to deal with for any kind of enjoyable involvement.

163796281;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Assume Good Faith Does Not Mean Have Blind Faith Despite the Facts==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy repeatedly  for months  citing a book published by St. Martin's Press (New York), ``Feeling Your Pain,`` as a source of chapter-long damning criticism of the National Civilian Community Corps, LoverOfArt was abusing the name of a respected publishing house and misleading Wikipedia readers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat St. Martin's Press would publish a book does not of course imply that no competing or contradictory facts exist.  But it does imply that the information has survived a responsible vetting process by fact checkers and lawyers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(By the way, according to the flap copy of the book,``Feeling Your Pain,`` (at least as published in hardcover by St. Martin's Press, 2000), the writing of the author, Bovard, ``has been denounced by FBI Director Louis Freeh, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the White House AIDS czar, as well as by the Chiefs of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. International Trade Commission.``)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs is now clear, ``Feeling Your Pain`` does not even mention NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps (except in the footnotes, referring to one speech by then-President Clinton  not exactly a source of documented criticism of a program he signed into law), in a chapter devoted to what was then 50,000 members of AmeriCorps, not the 1100+ Corps Members of NCCC.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo to Dbiel and Che Nuevara: It took a lot to get me to sound off about LoverOfArt. I responded calmly to his repeated rants about me, saying I was foaming at the mouth, my writing was Lunacy, fluff, and similar crap.  At this point his ``editing`` of the National Civilian Community Corps has been conclusively demonstrated as biased and maliciously distorted:  his doctoring of quotes into misleading criticisms of the National Civilian Community Corps (quoting NCCC as having been labeled a ``fraud`` in an article he cites that does not mention NCCC) should disqualify him from being part of this group.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen I read what he wrote and posted at Wikipedia, quoting the author of Feeling Your Pain as calling NCCC a ``fraud`` in an article he cites (untrue), saying the author devoted an entire chapter of his book to criticism of NCCC (untrue)  in a book published by St. Martin's Press, even I started to doubt the litany of glowing reports from credible and verifiable sources that I had read about this organization.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSomeone unfamiliar with positive reports about NCCC would have been even more likely to greet news of the demise of NCCC - something ardently sought recently by persons using the same kinds of arguments LoverofArt posted  with detachment, if not pleasure.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat his statements  quotes  about NCCC are now known to be false and misleading means that he no longer enjoys an assumption of Good Faith.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo I would like you to spare me your lectures about my supposed sins. ``No information is better than misleading information,`` as Jimbo Wales liked to say. LoverOfArt has no business mauling the content of this page, nor does Wikipedia have any business disseminating his posts.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am perfectly ready and willing to work respectfully and cooperatively with any editor who has not used the vicious and underhanded methods that LoverofArt has resorted to.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have shown a willingness to respond to your editorial concerns. Dbiel wanted more notable sources. I posted a number of them quickly, including citations from the Baltimore Sun, the NY TImes, The Washington Times, and an Arizona newspaper - news outlets reflecting a spectrum of points of view.  (LoverofArt discounted all of the Baltimore Sun citations, saying none were notable.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't maintain that my copy (or my view of what should be at the NCCC page) is perfect or unassailable or that other's work has no place. I have labeled some posts ``suggested edits.``  I have no problem with honest content that is in context that runs counter to my perspective.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut LoverofArt is clearly willing to resort to dishonest (or at the very least, grossly misleading) editing to ensure that his view prevails.  My editing reflects my perspective, but it  is not dishonest:  I present information that is verifiable and accurate, to the best of my ability.  If I make a mistake, and I sometimes do, I try to correct it, and I would welcome the correction of others - I do not want to be have a part in disseminating inaccurate or misleading information.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI left LoverofArt's Criticisms page on the NCCC article for a long time, until I could verify whether or not it was accurate.

163975796;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Comments on your work as administrator===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow that the dust has cleared a bit, I thought it fitting to give you some feedback on the events of a couple of days ago. Do you know what a kyosaku is? In the zendo, when you ``lose your mind``, you can request to be struck on the shoulder with a bamboo stick, to recover your alertness. Even if unrequested, I consider the block you imposed on me as a kyosaku, a welcome reminder not to let emotions get the better of me. After all, Wikipedia practice is very much like zen practice: You have to drop your ego to write well, and if done well the writing itself cuts ego further.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENParadoxically, however, that good effect came out of an action that was not so good. It came from an abuse of power, by you against me. When I am dealing with another user who laces his edits with vulgarities and ad hominem attacks, what I expect from the administrators is not one-sided, vindictive reactions, even if for a moment I lose my temper, but even-handed action that restores order and helps everyone maintain the focus on the writing. I am disappointed that you were not able to provide that this time around.

164049982;"`in... division 2 or something like that, and all teams can move, or be relegated. It's all this ``professional`` stuff, when you dont give the same chance to everyone. For example this year a what would be maybe called ``farm team`` (Brommapojkarna) with one of the best youth academy in Sweden. Went to the highest division of Swedish football. Something that isnt possible in USA (right?).  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe real reason why soccer is not popular in the US is that advertisers have to wait until half-time to screen commercials, making it financially unattractive. As the Bedford Reader puts it: NEWLINE_TOKENThe reason stems partly from the basic nature of  commercial television which exists not to inform and entertain but to sell. During most major sporting events on television- football, baseball, basketball, producers can take advantage of natural interruptions in the action  to broadcast sales pitches; or if the natural breaks occur too infrequently, the producers can contrive time-outs for the sole purpose of airing lucrative commercials. But soccer is played in two soled halves of forty-five minutes each: not even injury to a player is cause for a time-out. How, then, to insert the requisite number of commercial breaks without resorting to false fouls or other questionable tactic? After CBS aired a soccer match in 1967, players reported, according to Stanley Frank, that before the game the referee had instructed them ``to stay down every nine minutes.`` The resulting hue and cry rose all the way to the House Communications Subcommittee. From that day to this, no one has been able to figure out how to screen advertising jingles during a televised soccer game. The result is that commercial television has treated soccer almost as if didn't exist.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I notice no mention was made of the NHL? Three 20 minute periods? It is though a weak argument though as there are advert breaks in every commercial TV station no matter what the country, the United States is no different in that regard to other contries, all of whom manage to obtain lucrative advertising for football matches. Sky Sports in the UK for instance make full use of advert breaks, such as when the teams come out onto the pitch before the match, they immediately go to an ad break. Big matches attract huge advertising. · NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==top of talk page banner==NEWLINE_TOKENThe banner is incorrect.

The anglo-saxons weren't (until converted much later) - they saved Britain from civilisation  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::It's not a very good idea to restart an old thread on this talk page. Troublesome editor Scipio3000 disappeared from the WP some time ago and I added the sentence about the ``legalization of Christianity after four centuries of imperial persecution``. Please look at the edit history of the page and the article itself. This is not a forum or a place to air opinions. Your remarks above are offensive and racist. Please could you remove them?   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::As an anglo-saxon myself (or as near as one can get these days - I've stopped ticking British on forms because I have never felt ``British`` - I tick ``white other`` - why am I not allowed to be English any more?), I don't understand your reference to rascist and offensive. The view that the anglo-saxons saved us from civilization, is, at most, ironic, and surely reflects the ``traditional`` self-depreciating style of English humour, and/or English speech. Additionally, I am not sure why you feel the pursuit of excellence has an end. Anyway, aren't you supposed to assume good  faith http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith ? Mariya - x -  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::I can do one of those ridiculous ``more English than you`` things if you want, but it is very silly. My real surname is Mediaeval English. People with the same surname as me were related to Edward II (but I have no evidence of a connection between them and me, although it is not at all a common surname - I am clearly from the ``poor`` branch) - and they have a few old streets named after them, if you know where to look. In my bloodline (although there are gaps not accounted for), I have yet to find a single individual not born in England. That's pretty English, don't you think? There is even a market town in England, where by blood or by marriage, I am related to about half the inhabitants. I'm so very English, I am almost certainly a bit inbred. There we are. Anyway, enjoy your breakfast. Mariya - x -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::I still can't understand how the remarks you added are directly related to the editing of the article on Europe. They seem to be the sort of remarks that would normally be added on a forum with a little ) for good measure. Where did I mention the ``pursuit of excellence``? Did you mean ``self-deprecating`` by any chance? Born near the home of the Venerable Bede, almost a geordie, I rarely call myself English. Of course I do at the moment here in France, in the brief period before next Saturday: I narrowly escaped having a tricoleur painted on my face last Saturday. The french of course use anglo-saxon as a put-down )  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: Edward II of ``red hot poker`` fame? As mentioned in the Flower of Scotland? Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. That explains everything. Have you sought help?  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::: 'Fraid so. Anyway, I thought ethnic origin was self-defined, so I can be what I want, and you can be what you want, even if we were (and I am fairly sure we are not) siblings. Similarly, the French can describe Anglo-saxons in any way they want, but it might be inappropriate for these pages. I am not concerned about being a Rosbif (I think that's how it goes) even though I haven't eaten it for 15 years. The Venerable Bede certainly wasn't ashamed to be English - re. the great quote about when he gets to Heaven. By ``pursuit of excellence`` I was referring to the continuous, and unending, work of ``Historical Truth``. That's why History excites me - it should be fixed but it isn't!! Mariya - x -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::Historical truth? Doesn't that depend on who writes the history books? I'm not sure that  would have liked Terry Jones' series  ``Barbarians`` very much. BTW you seem so english that I suspect that you have midnight feasts of scones and clotted cream, probably washed down with a thimbleful or two of vodka.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::Historical Truth - exactly - that's one of the reasons it changes. Mr Jones' series was very popular, and he is a very entertaining presenter, but that doesn't make it historically accurate. I could have another ``long`` discussion with you on Mr Jones. Sorry about the vodka - I don't drink anymore - gave that up too! I used to brew my own mead though, 20 years ago. Perhaps if I drank a little more, things would all make sense. What about you - drinking Newkie brown, or the local stuff, or something else. Mariya - x -  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::: I also question the accuracy of Barbarians. The Life of Brian was far more scholarly, probably more accurate than many biblical passages. I only have experience of Newcastle Brown from when it was 26p a bottle. Have you tried Lindisfarne mead, from one of the homes of our great St Cuthbert?   —Preceding comment was added at  `;1484;1.0

I was forwarded your comments on her user page and wanted to make initial contact with you to see what I need to provide to you in order to get this page created in a way that will hopefully keep it from getting deleted anymore? The intent from the Director of MCWAR is a stand alone wikipedia page if possible, however, in your comments you did mention possibly being able to make it a subsection to the MCU page. Ultimately the desired endstate is MCWAR on wikipedia, so whatever that ends up taking. I have no history on wikipedia, and barely pass as computer saavy, so I am definitely treading in unknown waters right now. I am more than willing to do the leg work, research, and typing, but we definitely need outside support to get this page permanently posted. The easiest form of contact for me would be through email at JARED.DALTON@USMC.MIL. Please just let me know what works best for you and how to begin.

406162325;`NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::You neatly avoided the issue of WFCC #1, which you raised. It makes no difference whether or not those text ``logos`` are ``official``, they are not used in any capacity on the uniforms or in the venues of the teams in question, and thus cannot serve as ``equivalent`` replacements for the logo that millions of people have been exposed to over decades and have come to recognize as THE identifier of the school's teams. The text logo might be used solely on the letterhead of the various team sports for all we know, but it certainly isn't used by the teams themselves, and thus doesn't serve the encyclopedic purpose of serving as an identifier for them. It's pretty disingenuous to suggest that any encyclopedia (other than one manipulated by a few people who simply enjoy being disruptive) would ever have an article about USC football, basketball, etc. without providing the primary logo used by those teams. But I guess that's why my professors laugh when anyone asks if using Wikipedia as a reliable source is acceptable, and thanks to people like the two I've dealt with here, I guess they'll always be laughing when students ask that question. Congrats on perpetuating the stereotype!`;694;0.0

Under the Scientology cross it is written Religious/Commercial. The reference is a simple opinion from somebody very seriously anti-Scientologist who is presenting straight lies about the status of the Church for example in Germany. I do not know about France, but in Germany the church has always been registered as a non-profit organization. The German courts have recognized Scientology's religious bona fides (original, true religion status) in over 40 cases. (!) On 12 December 2003, the Administrative Court of Appeal of Baden-Würtenberg determined that the Church of Scientology Stuttgart is a religious organization protected under the German Constitution. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn June 2004, the Hamburg State Administrative Court of Appeal determined that actions taken by the Hamburg government to discriminate against Scientologists interfered with their right to religious freedom protected by Article 4 of the German Constitution. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe European Court of Human Rights issued an unanimous landmark decision on 5 April 2007 in favour of the Secientology religion, upholding the religious freedom of Scientologists and their religious associations throughout the 48 nations that have signed and ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), adopted by the council of Europe in 1950. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1993 the American Government ruled that: 1.) Scientology is a bonafide (original, true) religion; 2) The Churches of Scientology and their related charitable and educational institutions are operated exclusively for recognized religious purposes; 3) The Churches of Scientology and their related charitable and educational institutions operate for the benefit of the public interest rather than the interest of private individuals. So anyone calling Scientology a cult or sect is in the best case not well informed and is getting information from the wrong source that is one of the most basic mistakes a Journalist can do.NEWLINE_TOKENIn fact Scientology is officially recognized as a true religion already in Australia, Croatia, Albania, Slovenia, Hungary, Portugal, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, USA, Venezuela, Brazil, New Zealand, Nepal, Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Kazakhstan, Ecuador, Costa Rica, India, Philippines, Sri Lanka ... furthermore it is recognized by administrative and judicial decisions in: Italy, Denmark, Austria, united Kingdom, Norway and in Germany.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo what is written under the cross, that Scientology is ``commercial``, should be really removed. It is really not fail, not clever, not OK and it is just pure defamation and anti-Scientology propaganda, carefully invented by ill-intentioned people. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd I really  really do not understand why is it that any anti-Scientologist can edit the Scientology web site, because it is full of anti-Scientology hate propaganda, and Scinetologists can not respond to it.

I am shocked on this!!!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyeay, this ``commercial`` stuff is really not OK.

In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a ``good`` image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou had some advice on how I should spend my ``blocked time`` by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress ``sleazy``, then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing ``accurate`` information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in yourCarry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that `` it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat `` - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual  life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCarry on with your scribble game.

You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too.

Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.NEWLINE_TOKENSO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE.

First, always look at Wikipedia policies if you think there is an issue, don't just go away angry. I know that I'm still learning Wikipedia policies and just reading the above I can see that in 2007-2008 period I was somewhat confused about a couple of them.

Anyway, I'll respond in interest of full disclosure, outline questions I think have to be asked on the talk page of any editor here who gives any indication of being familiar with the issue, and suggest some possible ways of dealing with WP:COI issues here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===My possible WP:COI===NEWLINE_TOKEN*To answer Lordradish's question, I have contributed 43 blog entries to the secessionist blog Vermont Commons over the last 38 months. I have not been paid.  My blog entries have been more generally related to the topic of secession and occasionally make passing references to Vermont and its secession issues, including in comments on others' entries. I don’t live in Vermont and don't intend to. I don't consider myself a member of any Vermont Secession group. As far as I remember, I only have corresponded with the Vermont Commons editor, and that by email. I get some irregular Vermont Commons email and mailings and occasional Second Vermont Republic snail mails. NEWLINE_TOKEN*I also have suffered a couple years of vicious and even libelous off wiki attacks from the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot, including because I edited this page, and including at another blogspot page he set up just to ridicule me with incredible sexist ire. Therefore I have come to know far more about what types of individuals may be making very POV and COI edits to this article than I would have otherwise.NEWLINE_TOKEN*I do feel I have sufficient COI to make sure I declare it, as I now have, and to be very careful of my edits per WP:COI#Editors_who_may_have_a_conflict_of_interest. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Possible WP:COI of other editors=== NEWLINE_TOKENIn the 2007-2008 period there was some extreme POV editing of this article by individuals who I believe had very strong personal and financial connections to Vermont organizations and individuals, far stronger than mine.

Therefore here are some questions that might have to be asked on such suspected persons' talk pages (or here, but guidance on that appreciated).

410701161;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi Malik, Standing up to racism and bullying is not a ``hole`` neither is a wikipedia account. I have Radh accusing me of being a ``Stalinist`` on many places on wikipedia while he follows me from article to article. I hate Stalin. He has some vested interest in ``exposing Communism`` and we are all supposed agree with his povs.  defended Radh's usage of Robeson as a good ``Uncle Tom`` under the conniving guise of ``context``  and ``Robeson being dead.`` She ignored his nasty ``Neo-Stalinist bully`` comment(s) (as you predictably did ) and defended him again. I ran this all by a PHD student at CAL. That's racism, that's a slur(s) and that's reality. If I had used ``nigger`` or ``Uncle Tom?`` Oh my! You'd have blocked me instantaneously.

410896381;`NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Not necessarily.

Pretty much all of the law except that of their own making was against them.  The land they bought was improperly granted by Benning Wentworth, the governor of New Hampshire.  Some of the grants were made even after he agreed to stop doing so (for example, those purchased by Ethan Allen in the 1770s were made after King George III ruled against Wentworth and declared the territory to be New York's).  New York uncharitably refused to recognize Wentworth's grants without paying additional fees to New York; money most of the grantees did not have.  This is what started the resistance.NEWLINE_TOKEN:The resistance was complicated by the fact that there were grantees who wanted New York rule; this complication was especially problematic in the greater Brattleboro area.  In my opinion, this dispute had precious little to do with the Crown, and lots to do with inter-colonial territorial rivalries, complicated by interpersonal rivalries.  When you claim things like ``the crown was trying to steal their land``, it's like someone whose car title has been declared invalid by a judge complaining that the President of the United States is trying to steal his car.

If those interesting in my edits to the Sante Kimes article, please just see the article's edit history.NEWLINE_TOKENSince making editing mistakes on my FIRST-EVER edits on Wikipedia, I have complied with the appropriate editing guidelines.NEWLINE_TOKENNamely,NEWLINE_TOKEN*Posting in the discussion page of the article about ANY large edits I felt appropriate for the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN* Placing details and reason for the edit in editing tags.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Please see the article's editing history to see that the only edits I have made were to correct dates, spelling mistakes, adding verifying tags, and making small corrections to the article that were needed. Furthermore I gave full details for the changes I made in the editing notes Please see the article's editing history to confirm this.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*3. The only edit that I made that was in debate was the article's 'lead' info.NEWLINE_TOKENI do contend that the current 'lead' starting with ``American felon`` was placed there as an action of spite by that editor.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe 'lead' I placed WAS of a neutral POV, factual WITH EXACT dates for the named convictions and was supported by references. NEWLINE_TOKENThe current 'lead' does not state the dates for when these conviction took place. NEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, I had placed ``American woman`` in the 'lead', which IS in the 'lead' of various other female criminal's articles who (arguable) allegedly committed WORSE crimes than Sante Kimes is accused of committing.NEWLINE_TOKENIf it's appropriate for those articles, why is it not appropriate for this article?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:In closing, I DID follow editing guidelines for the Sante Kimes article after I learned what was acceptable editing.NEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, I discussed - at length - in the article's discussion page about changes that I felt WERE needed. Yet I NEVER took it upon myself to edit those issues until an agreement could be reached. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*I would like to point out that those changes have yet been agreed upon and I HAVE NOT made any edit in regard to those issues. Therefore, that demonstrates that I am following the editing guidelines.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBecause of an apparent personal problem an administrator has with me. - Which is the same editor I was in dispute with on this article's discussion page They have asked me to voluntarily not edit the article - or, most outrageously, not EVEN post on the article's discussion page to discuss the issues with this article.(How is this not considered conflict of interest??)  NEWLINE_TOKENI have complied with that request, even though I have not yet read or been advised as to what guideline I was in violation of in regard to the Sante Kimes article or it's discussion page.`;1516;0.0

Take a break and stop trying to overpower this article just due to the fact that you are overtly biased and seem to have nothing else to do.  I would like to hear from multiple other editors.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    `;1155;0.0

412898129;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHello, thank you very much.  Yes unfortunately someone decided to go ahead and delete the page before anybody could mediate.  After 10 days the discussion was still very much active and no warning was given of deletion, or consideration of the fact that I requested mediation to resolve serious questions pertaining to bias and bad-faith.  Also, during deletion review I have shown that it is doubtful that the closing admin even read the AFD arguments properly and probably wasn't even aware that mediation had been requested.  This admin says there was clear consensus but the fact is that it was claerly shown during AFD that the advocates for deletion could not motivate their own statements, instead chosing to default anyway with ``Delete`` endorsements.  I am told that the onus of proof lies on me yet I have addressed every single criticism repeatedly whereas they could not and did not submit proof for their own statements.  Also there were many supporters who presented arguments for 'keep' (probably outweighing the number who wanted 'delete') but these arguments were never addressed and the guys at deletion review are telling me that these contributions have zero weight because the people who want to 'keep' are all first-time users.  Deletion review is also proving unhelpful and in my opinion also biased with nobody seriously considering the arguments that have been raised, or really prepared to read through the AFD discussion properly.  I have no idea of what to do next and in fact if anything can be done.  I am extremely disillusioned with this process as it is obvious that prejudgements and lots of Wiki-speak are employed to 'prove' unsuitability, rather than arguments being actually objectively considered. Anyway, thank you for your willingness to help even though it appears to be too late now.   `;1480;0.0

What I had written was certainly not a lengthy series of poorly written insults. Lengthy yes, because you deserved it. Poorly written - Certainly not. But then you would have to have a very good grasp of the English vocabulary to understand good English language, which you presumably or rather most certainly don't. And anyways, since you must be rarely coming across good English, it would probably be difficult for you to understand the quality of it, since you are always busy scribbling on this scribble book of yours called Wikipedia. Also, you mentioned that in case I need any specific help from you, I should keep the message brief and clearly explain what I want you to do. I am keeping it very brief and telling you that I for sure, do not need any help from you, but you certainly require help in real life. So, I am quite clearly explaining you to go, and get some help in real life, instead of scribbling away in virtual life. Anyways, I am not going to be concerned with this matter henceforth and so, put a full stop to it here. So, I will not be bothering to check your reply to this final message. I have nothing to do with this entire issue anymore. I close this matter by using the most appropriate words for you – FISH OFF.;2028;0.0

And I know the 2 things needed, the other bunch of stuff with the lead is redundent as a bunch of GA and I've seen one on FAC not having links in lead. However if you look at the review, I'm not familiar with whitewash or Madien(in a sporting context for both as I know the historical context to whitewash), sorry but we may differ here on views but this is not Wikipedia for the specials. Also I am an accedmic (undergrade) so I know all about dumbing down to a point but linking basic terms for a non english speaker thats a bit too far, especially since this is and encyclopeia for English speakers. If your reading it and review it then a comprensable level of English would be presumed by even the most unassuming English native. Personally I do not want to stick with what he has said and rather have a clean break and have a restarted review by someone with a capable level of English.   ;354;0.0

The user: user:Boing! said Zebedee restored previous version claiming that the footnote has sound information. I still consider that this reference should be deleted.``  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Got it, thanks - I've replied and will watch the Talk page. (I'm off to bed now though, so any further comment will have to wait until tomorrow).    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Name ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJust out of interest,did you get your name from The Magic Groundabout?   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Magic Roundabout, yes.    NEWLINE_TOKEN::Sorry,that's what I meant!   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== CheckUser ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have reported a case of a sockpuppet and requested CheckUser but then actually discovered what it is. I misread the description when i requested it. I thought it said someone else would do but it actually says i will use it. Is there any way i can cancel this request?   NEWLINE_TOKEN:I can only suggest you edit your SPI report, state you made a mistake, and ask for it to be withdrawn.    NEWLINE_TOKEN::I actually don't know how to do this as it's a first for me. I just wondered if you could tell me what to do. Do I have to just write under where it says i have requested it that i made a mistake and i don't want it anymore. This is the page:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Watderp#06_February_2011_2   What will happen from now for this case?   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::He's also just blanked the investigation page.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::::(I added a comment asking for the SPI to be withdrawn    )NEWLINE_TOKEN::::I don't want to withdraw the report i just want to withdraw the checkuser request.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Well edit it and add a comment under mine saying exactly what you want!    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::And listen up, Gobbleswoggler - numerous people have told you numerous times to stop trying to do things you don't understand properly and which are beyond your competence. So do your football stats, do some very slow and careful reverts of blatant vandalism, and NOTHING ELSE. Do not file SPI reports, and do not venture into any other areas, unless you can get some adoption/mentorship from someone willing to take the time to try to teach you. To be honest, I'll be surprised if you last the day without being blocked again.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::And having looked closer, your sockpuppet report looks badly wrong to me. Firstly, it is common, and not prohibited, for someone to start editing using an IP address and then go on to register an account to edit. And secondly, you should not accuse two people of being sockpuppets just because they both edited the same article - especially not when they made very different edits.    NEWLINE_TOKEN::::I put this because i thought it was a bit more of a coincidence that two new editor were,to me vandalising. Watdurp was calling Kilheeney a cheater and Fergyc123 was showing him handballing a football which i counted as vandalism so i thought one person has created two accounts both for vandalism.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Nope, the only edit  made was this, which says nothing about cheating.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Hi ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am not familiar with the talk page system, but I hope I got it right this time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI send you this message regarding the articles of Alexshinia. I hope the following facts will help in making matters more clear:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) The country exists only in a book, while the organization is yet too anonymous to be known.NEWLINE_TOKEN2) All members, including the book's writer, are anonymous on the Internet. NEWLINE_TOKEN3) If you are still not satisfied enough to let the articles remain once I rewrite them, ask anything you need to know and I shall do my best to answer.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Hi. If the book is as yet unknown, and the authors are anonymous, then they have not achieved the notability needed for a Wikipedia article. To be considered notable, what you want to write about (the book itself, and the details about Alexshinia), must have been covered by multiple independent source which you can quote in the article. Have a read of WP:N to learn something about Wikipedia's notability requirements, and WP:RS to find out about reliable sourcing of articles.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe sources are me, my organization and the books that will be published in 2012. If that isn't enough, then I am currently working on a new wiki only containing Alexshinia-related information.NEWLINE_TOKEN:No, that is not enough - as I said, you need multiple independent sources. Please do read WP:RS. Good luck with your new wiki    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Block ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn Beeblebrox's page you have put,do you think it is about time. Are you referring to me being blocked again. Cos if that is the case,i'll stick to just Stiki,spellcheck and manual editing instead of trying things i'm not sure about.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Sorry dude, you have made that promise multiple times and have broken it every time - what Beeblebrox does now is up to him.    NEWLINE_TOKEN::One last chance?  I really do not want to be blocked again.I was actually really bored.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I'll answer over on your Talk page, because I want to say a few things in general that I think would be worth keeping on your record for possible future reference.    NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Ok,that's fine.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::In your opinion,if I continued using Stiki at the moment in the right way,i might escape a ban because,like you say,i'm trying to edit in a good way not vandalize wikipedia. Oh,and i'm 13.I really don't want to be banned and i mean that from the bottom of my heart.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Gobbleswoggler please use your talk page and stop clogging up BSZ's with all your comments that he has asked you a. To not do something if your not sure, and b. To use your talk page. There is nothing else you need to say here, at least. Check your talk page.

There should be good ones in the relativity articles, but I have not looked around yet. Cheers,   `;1378;0.0
413917403;`NEWLINE_TOKEN::Thanks.  Re ``penultimate`` etc, either is fine really.  I was thinking of the Overmind as the end point in my choice of word, but ``last`` may be clearer, especially as we will have readers who are not very familiar with English.  I suppose I imagine the children were still physically, superficially, human despite their empty facial affect.  Of course Karellen or Rashaverak had explicitly stated they were ``no longer human`` much earlier, even before the tsunami.  I thought the biographical material was good and interesting, except for two sentences not very germane to CE: ``Clarke enrolled at King's College London .... editor for Science Abstracts.``  Perhaps those should be moved to the ACC article.  (I think all of the bio info should be incorporated into the ACC article as well, if it is not there already.)

To my interpretation and knowledge, the paradigm of Wikipedia vandalism requires each instance to be handled on a case by case basis.

The blocking mechanism allows sufficient consequence for most of these types of infraction.

You likely would revert the edit and warn the user about spamming on Wikipedia. This pebble would not necessitate police powers.

414635571;NEWLINE_TOKEN*Master, you have shown me the error of my ways. I bow to your veteran supremacy (after all, you have over 3,000 editsI'm not even in the neighborhood), and will firmly believe, from now on, that your block log is simply the result of a conspiracy against you, as it usually is with people who are right. Seriously, I will grant that I was wrong about the Tricycle blogit's a blog, but it's on Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, and that gives it credibility. The next time you remove it (I presume out of childish spite, with your usual venom thrown in), the next time you remove reliable sources (whether in Dutch or Esperanto) from the article, the next time you insult me or anyone else in an edit summary, we will meet on WP:CIVIL or WP:ANI (you've been there beforeyou know how it works). Calling people an idiot, an ass, whatever, may be OK in your world, but it's not OK here.   ;99;0.0

Dr. Larry Sanger's claim to co-foundership here is more credible than your claims of sole credit, and no not because he's the doctorate holder and you're not. I believe him because he reads more to me in my judgment more authentic about his feelings and he's more a straight shooter than you.

I must have been half asleep when I read your edit - it is perfectly clear and it was my reading that was blurry.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Actually, I believe that Boccherini's piano quintets preceded Dussek's (http://imslp.org/wiki/6_Piano_Quintets,_G.413-418_%28Op.57%29_%28Boccherini,_Luigi%29). But Boccherini's quintets (and, I am guessing, Dussek's as well - I can't find a score for them) are not anything like Schumann's. There is no real interplay between the quartet and the keyboard (which, actually, might have been a cembalo in Boccherini's thought), the first violin doubling the right hand, the cello the bass line, almost throughout. So I think it is fair to say that Schumann invented the form, at least as we know it today.   ;980;0.0

417736226;`NEWLINE_TOKENCommentI'm   from above, apparently the page has been protected for some reason. Anyways, google hits don't determine Wikipedia page titles, and neither does consensus in the media. When is there ever any consensus on contentious topics in the media? The question is if there is an authoritive, verifiable source that we can all agree would back up the change on here. Clearly that consensus doens't exist yet, but it is worth noting that there is no common name being given to this ``occurance`` shall we call it within the media, for some its an uprising, for some its a civil war, for some its a just rebels and pro-gaddafi forces. But the article does have to be named something, and clearly the Libyan case is quite different from the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt (which wikipedia is now calling revolutions, but which began as uprisings in name here). If a successful uprising is named a revolution, then what shall we call an uprising which cannot be decisively defeated or won by either side? I believe that is the textbook definition of a civl war.`;3679;0.0

418600425;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Proposed Additions to the Barton Buhtz text..  ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am going to add in some other text from the Buhtz article. This should help to show what the Redemption Movement is about ACCORDING TO AN ACTUAL REDEMPTIONIST. BE WARNED: This text is not in harmony with Wikipedia's never give credit to anything that was stated by someone who later on broke the law, whether or not it had anything to do with the idea they quoted with purveying unspoken rule. The text will read.. NEWLINE_TOKENRedemption movement proponent Barton Buhtz has written that when a UCC form is processed by a state's UCC filing office, it becomes a public legal record/fact and that those who have filed UCC-1 Financing Statements correctly have not broken the law. Buhtz states that no court can dispute the validity of a properly filed UCC-1 financing statement.

But Toyota is so inconsistent with the naming that let's wait and see if it sticks. Wikipedia should use the most common name.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::;294;0.0

In my eyes it undermines your position as an impartial arbiter and reflects upon your reputation. Overall in my view your handling of the matter has been so far lacklustre at best. You practically admitted that your decision to block me was made on impulse (you initially put a wrong reason as grounds for the block). It seems you are concentrated on watching me while turning a blind eye on how I am being treated. When one of the accusers calls me an 'unfortunate fella' and you choose to ignore it, am I correct to assume that I can also call my opponents 'unfortunate fellas' or you as a watchdog will block me for another 'personal attack'?  I think your last remark is absolutely unwarranted. ``Please stop telling people not to post here``? I was not telling I was asking and very politely for that matter, as I do not want my talk page to be turned into an incoherent pile rather than than what Wikipedia creators intended it to be. I think your popping up like that and commenting a minor post of mine looks like another impulsive decision unworthy or an administrator, and also comes dangerously close to what may be interpreted as open bias and prejudice. I kindly ask to get off my back - you really need not be there, I am not such a loose cannon that scrutiny of every little post of mine would be justified. I perceive such excessively close 'guidance' as pressure, and I will act accordingly if I feel your actions contradict your status of an administrator. This is not a threat - it's a statement of my position and my intentions if such treatment continues.  `;2414;0.0

It is a matter of an apparent breach  of a moral obligation by Sven Manguard to me. I worked hard with Wikimedia Australia over a three-month period to develop an idea in great detail, which is complex and has many original elements. I conveyed some of the details to Manguard after he assured me he had no intention of developing anything remotely similar. I was then told by a third party that ``Sven grabbed me on IRC to tell me he is planning a similar project`` and that Sven had said ``well, I'm going ahead with it``. Manguard has since said on my talk page, ``you missed your chance, your partnership fell through, and if there is even the slightest chance of it coming to fruition, it's not going to be for several more months. I'm not going to drop my efforts, and I'm not going to wait indefinitely for something that at this point I'm pretty sure is never going to happen ...``. Actually, the partnering institution had already agreed in principle, and there has simply been a delay in implementation. I have been led to believe that others in the WMF have been apprised of the idea; but I'm in the dark as to what level of detail he has divulged, and whether clearly identifiable details of my scheme have been or will be duplicated without attribution. If distinctive and original details are being conveyed contrary to his undertaking to me, it is a moral breach; and if they are implemented without attribution to me, that is also a moral breach; if this occurs, I believe I have a moral right to inform people of it. This is the gist of what I said to Manguard, but now I'm been accused of making ``legal threats``; this is based on a complete misunderstanding. In fact, I don't have a legal foot to stand on in that respect, and he knows it. Why is this being construed as anything ``legal``? For all we know, Manguard's ideas might be quite different; but he needs to communicate them as a courtesy as much as a practicality.I was the person who suggested publicly that Manguard and Adam be ``directors`` at FSC, only a few weeks ago. I believe Manguard has done good work there, so I don't understand why this spin-out is happening. It has quickly morphed into accusations of ``gross incivility, threats of off-wiki harassment, and personal attacks``. I see no evidence of gross incivility by me (aside from an unkind thing I said on his talk page yesterday—``not mature enough``—which I'm willing to withdraw), nor of personal attacks. Instead, I have endured major and repeated personal attacks on his and my talk pages. No one has mentioned those.This seems to have been mixed up with complaints about my reviewing at FSC: they are surely two different issues. If people are troubled by professional reviews of soundfiles, I think there's a big problem for features sounds. I have presented factual evidence and what I believe are balanced opinions, and have supported a few WP-produced files, too. I encourage WPians to present their own performances for FS promotion, just as our photographers do at FSC, but please let's review them professionally without fear or favour.   `";1551;0.0

421028058;`Weather section with warning? ==NEWLINE_TOKENThe weather section was removed with comment that it applies to any British mountain. Maybe something like that should be a fixed feature on all such pages then? My experience - and the core reason for adding it - was that it was a surprising change in weather (from clear and calm before ascent and during ascent via Bakestall to estimated 30-40 mph winds and 100 yds visibility back to clear again within a few hours) combined with the fact that numerous people were dressed inappropriately and even met a couple who were lost although they were dressed as experienced walkers (they were very happy to meet someone who could tell them how to get down). For safety reasons, I went back down via Bakestall rather than the planned Long Side route (I couldn't find the path and other walkers were in same situation, plus I didn't consider it safe to walk in the windward side on an unknown path near supposedly steep drops with high velocity wind and little visibility). Skiddaw seems to be considered a somewhat easy/safe mountain and yet it appeared as potentially very dangerous on my first visit. Looking at the Skiddaw article it says ``...a number of stone windshelters have been erected. Given the prevailing conditions these have a predominantly psychological value`` - this implies imho that there is little use for them (again re-inforcing the perception that it is a easy/safe mountain). I found these windshelters both useful (gave a helpful rest out of the blistering winds) and a number of other walkers were also occupying several of them. I am not sure what is appropriate to include in the article but would suggest some kind of warning to reduce the risk of inexperienced walkers putting themselves in danger due to the article not having any warnings.

Maybe something like that should be a fixed feature on all such pages then? My experience - and the core reason for adding it - was that it was a surprising change in weather (from clear and calm before ascent and during ascent via Bakestall to estimated 30-40 mph winds and 100 yds visibility back to clear again within a few hours) combined with the fact that numerous people were dressed inappropriately and even met a couple who were lost although they were dressed as experienced walkers (they were very happy to meet someone who could tell them how to get down). For safety reasons, I went back down via Bakestall rather than the planned Long Side route (I couldn't find the path and other walkers were in same situation, plus I didn't consider it safe to walk in the windward side on an unknown path near supposedly steep drops with high velocity wind and little visibility). Skiddaw seems to be considered a somewhat easy/safe mountain and yet it appeared as potentially very dangerous on my first visit. Looking at the Skiddaw article it says ``...a number of stone windshelters have been erected. Given the prevailing conditions these have a predominantly psychological value`` - this implies imho that there is little use for them (again re-inforcing the perception that it is a easy/safe mountain). I found these windshelters both useful (gave a helpful rest out of the blistering winds) and a number of other walkers were also occupying several of them.

Note that the names used in these articles were chosen after many months of discussions, discussions that included a wide variety of editors.  The compromise solution was to use Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol, the Province of Trento, and the Province of Bolzano-Bozen.  This was a compromise that kept both the Italian and German usage in the names, and was also the usage in Encyclopedia Britannica (to name just one major English source).  There is slander going on above by Mai-Sachme when he says that individuals engineered this solution, or did it by some form of trickery.  He also went as far as to erase a similar warning to the reviewing administrator.  It is a little shocking, but maybe not surprising, that after a few years a certain editor tries to put things back to how he originally had placed them unilaterally.  Right here what we are seeing is nothing less than than a ambush of this page and I strongly suspect that he has contacted a lot of these editors thru e-mail to ask them to come and support this ambush.   It is no coincidence that within a couple of days all the German-speaking users who happened to be against the compromise solution show up to vote for this.  This is utter abuse of Wikipedia.  So, again, if Wikipedia is at all fair, this move request should be struck down.  It is FACT that in English both the names Alto Adige and South Tyrol, AND Province of Bolzano are in regular use.  Go to any grocery in the United States, and products from this region are advertised as ``wine from Alto Adige`` or ``speck from Alto Adige``.  Yet, the same editor who makes this move request (and others who are voting here) has constitently attempted to marginalize the name Alto Adige on this page, or remove its bold typeface next to South Tyrol, or even acknowledge that it is used commonly in English (just review the edits made on these pages over the past year).  What it truly shameful is that this cements the fact that there is no room in these particular people's minds for compromise and to a solution that allowed an Italian/German naming convention.  Wikipedia is NOT a democracy, and this ambush of the page to try to revert the page to a German-centric viewpoint by sending a dozen German-speaking voters here is just wrong.`;555;0.0

This is a marketing decision made by inhabitants of this province.  Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.  But, some German speaking editors could never accept this, and want this article to match the German Wikipedia article, Sudtirol.  Ever wonder why they constantly remove Alto Adige from bold face and any statement recognizing its use in English?  Anyway, I really hate to even participate in this nonsense anymore, but this move request is nothing less than abuse of Wikipedia (but, hey, what's new).  The same old editors are trying to come in here and flood the voting to change what was a decision made thru many weeks and months of discussions, and to a naming convention that is clearly biased towards a German point of view.  So, I don't doubt that your intentions are genuine Dohn joe.  Be wary of what is going on here though...;3075;0.0

A bit weird they all show up within a couple days, isn't it?  LOL  The editor who made this move request regularly communicates offsite through e-mail, hence my suspicions.  Anyway, you'd think people could compromise, wouldn't you?  I guess history tells us that some humans are not capable of compromise...  So, anyway, as far as your research, and I'm not sure where you are based, but if you are in the United States, try dropping by a Whole Foods, etc.. and you'll see that products from this region are labeled as coming from Alto Adige.   This is a marketing decision made by inhabitants of this province.  Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.  But, some German speaking editors could never accept this, and want this article to match the German Wikipedia article, Sudtirol.  Ever wonder why they constantly remove Alto Adige from bold face and any statement recognizing its use in English?  Anyway, I really hate to even participate in this nonsense anymore, but this move request is nothing less than abuse of Wikipedia (but, hey, what's new).  The same old editors are trying to come in here and flood the voting to change what was a decision made thru many weeks and months of discussions, and to a naming convention that is clearly biased towards a German point of view.  So, I don't doubt that your intentions are genuine Dohn joe.  Be wary of what is going on here though...;168;0.0

422994698;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Italian ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHey Sajoch, if you can discuss things relaxed for a bit, I do have a question I'd like to ask a Ladin from Bolzano.  I always hear about the Italians coming and taking over.  But, can you explain to me who exactly are ``the Italians``?  As far as I know, Italian in the modern sense is simply a citizen of the Italian Republic.  Going back a few hundred years ago, I suppose people might say they are a people ``of Italy``, or the Italic peninsula.  But, I'd say that even to this day, many people in Italy don't refer to themselves as Italian first.  Aren't the people of Sicily, Sicilians?  The people of Napoli, Napolitani?  As far as I can tell, the ``Ladin`` are the people of the region we happen to call Trentino-Alto Adige, and also the Romansch speakers in Switzerland are speaking essentially the same (or a VERY similar) language.  It would make sense that this pocket of Europe has its own particular language, and a language which is old-Latin based.  So, when you say you are Ladin, and not Italian... to me that is no different from someone saying they are Sicilian, and not Italian.  Then that brings me back to my original question: who is actually Italian?  Isn't the Italian language the Tuscan language actually?  So are Italians actually the people from Tuscany?  I know that Trentino is said to be majority Italian, but the people there speak Italian in modern times because it is the national language.  They still speak their original dialects like Nones, Solardo, etc.. which are actually Ladin languages.  You know that, right?  So are the people in Trentino Ladin people, or have they transformed into Italians because the Italian Republic has a National Language?  I'm just throwing these questions out there, as someone interested in my own history.  I mentioned this once to noclador, ``who are the Italians?`` and all the discussion got me was him giving me the link to the Wikipedia page on Italians.  My guess is that some of the questions I was asking blurred the lines of a politics he would rather dream is black and white.  I'd like to see if you'd actually be interested to discuss this, as you are a fellow Ladin at least...`;586;0.0

An obvious way to do that would be with something like 'Admin:Dougweller' instead of 'User:Dougweller'. Or when an admin posts in their admin function, they simply state that they are admins. Consider how chaotic our society would be if police went up to people's doorsteps without letting them know that they are police.

One of the first things I note, however, is that you were incorrectly assuming that the John W. Brown is a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL).  It is not.

There about 2,500 sites and objects and historic districts that are NHLs, including the California Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien.

425659807;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Qwyrxian is correct. ArbCom is unlikely to rule on content, their whole ethos is to do with content and let the Wikipedia Community decide how to deal with content. I'm not going to object if someone refers this dispute there, but they will have to be proactive about it. Ajl1772, if you think ArbCom needs to deal with it I suggest you make an application as an uninvolved party. Otherwise there's no point in raising the prospect. I think Mediation would be more productive.   ;3392;0.0

I am no longer a teenager (though I became an admin at the age of 15). I actually take a harder line on younger users than most users do who are my age. I fully believe that there are users with an age < 18 who should not be administrators due to maturity issues. I don't think I've ever interacted with Dylan620, and I'm not going to support or oppose his RFA. However, the way you're going about this is wrong. The proper place to discuss such a policy change is at WT:RFA, not here. Just as the proper place to change the notability guideline is not at WP:AFD. Agitating over and over on every underage RFA with a controversial viewpoint just alienates users. Not only users who are underage, but those who are overage as well.

Other users have also left comments on his userpage telling him to stop stalking them and stirring up trouble. One of the main reasons i had to quit wikipedia was becuase the user GoodDay kept stalking my userpage and my edits, pasting around my IP address and causing trouble for me and keep talking about my brother, i don't know if this user is racist but my brother has had a problem with him, i feel unsafe on here also. If you checked my contributions for wikipedia over the last 2 years you would realise i have added far more than any of those users on the ANI board, i have no idea why i got banned for calling GoodDay for what he truly is, if you check the chatlogs you would see he has spouted out many abusive insults, i do not insult people i just call it as it is, i accept a 2 week ban then but please tell GoodDay to stop stalking my userpage, leaving me messages and pasting around my Ip address and spreading lies about my brother he seems to have an obession with, this is clearly all against wiki policy and abuse. also note i am most likely getting the local authorities in on this issue   ;1180;0.0

426537026;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== The Nazi Flag ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSeeing its prominence in the article made me suspicious from the start, not in the possible information it pertains to, which may or may not be valid in the way it is presented, but its placement instantly reeks that the edit was made to directly asscociate Socialism with Nazism. I decided to find which editor included it, lo and behold it was made by a user  with an aggresive anti-liberal/leftist standpoint and one with a prior warning of making disruptive and misleading edits to pages pertaining to figures involved in politics they don't happen to agree with []] []] []]. If the information must remain then it must be intergrated in an objective and less intentionally antagonistic manner. To be honest I'm rather disgusted that it's remained for this long as it has already proliferated through to dozens upon dozens of copycat Wiki articles across the web with even less standards than Wikipedia's own.   ;2639;0.0

426808074;NEWLINE_TOKEN::::i find it inexplicable that i tried to edit an article on guy fawkes when originally i only intended to use wikipedia on finding some information on polycarbonate roofing - how the hell i ended up at Guy Fawkes is beyond me. I guess i became curious as to who it was that striking out a true fact and thats when i started reading various sources about parrot-of-doom, nev1 and webhamster all of whom somehwere i read where in fact one person whose name i recall was kurt adkins. As i said dont ask me why or how i got there but i did - i think it was displacement behaviour when in reality i should have been researching polycarbonate roofing however its is not the most exciting subject in the world hence why i was easily distracted. For the record i had to create an account in order to rectify the mistake in the guy fawkes article and write something about polycarbonate roofing (as the subject is not in wikipedia) the name that i choose was a composite of the names that had previously cropped in my research in wikipedia.  ;1600;0.0

I just want that retarded section out of there. It's redundant when the section above it talks about the same thing. Now they haven't responded to me at all in the talk page (this have been going on for months mind you) and I can't report them for 3rr so I'd appreciate it if you would look into this. I think you being 'one of them' and a admin will help. Thanks.   ;2537;0.0

428320799;=Am I disruptive ?NEWLINE_TOKENSteve, the criticism of Calo's paper is addressed in the two articles by Cloonan and Trell  that are also in the Wikipedia article about Ruggero Santilli. These two articles were there, you ignored them and quickly eliminated the entire section. There was also another article about ongoing experiments that you ignored and cancelled...but you erased everything so nobody knows....in addition you and i are not qualified to take on pros or cons, just to report it and you avoided and prohibited that. I do not know where the idea of law suit came from. You are the one who got the three legal points and said that you were saying everything you wanted since no legal  suit could be won against you . What a fine example of editorial ethics, I already told what I think about your position, but you ignored it.  If you  do not want to add the articles, as are in the Wikipedia page itself , I could not care less, it is the loss of the readers who do not read about ongoing research with its pros and cons. I thought  it was interesting since I am sure there  are more and that shows a vital field of research. However I take issue with associating Santilli, with fraud, kook, fringe  and I am sure that it is against the rules of Wikipedia on libel and reckless behavior with the clear intent to damage since the fringe scientist definition is not supported by anything of value,  except, perhaps some blogs and  tabloids which, according to the rules, have no source value since they are not peer-reviewed articles!

First off it is widely reported in many WP:RS which makes it more than a self published claim.  Ultimately everything that is published originates with one person's claim, but when that claim is reproduced by reliable sources which are responsible for fact checking then it becomes admissible for wikipedia.  It is not Libel, if it was I am sure Davie would have already sent some lawyers to straighten it out (the church has a reputation for dealing with legal matters efficiently).  And it is not Gossip because it has a source, that source has been checked out by the reliable sources and they have chosen to report on it.  Additionally it has world wide reproduction (published in several languages) so it is also not inconsequential, it is a widely reported story which has such an impact both Davie and the church responded to it and has consequence for both organizations.  20:46, 15;733;0.0

You wrote an article on a woman whose crowning achievement seems to be that she ran a pottery company for something a bit over a year before World War II, with her husband, and yet you doubt the notability of a woman who has curated at least nine exhibitions over a period of 20 years at one of Australia's most important art galleries and continues to do so? Should I remind you that four years later your article only has one reference, no notes and no external links?NEWLINE_TOKEN*It's not that I dislike the disambiguation page. I'm all for it, and would certainly agree with adding a reference to a disambiguation page on this one, once the move has been made.

If someone else more notable comes along with a claim to that exact address, I'd happily support her taking this page, too.;1416;0.0

430293301;`NEWLINE_TOKEN::No, I'm sorry, at least about the italian publication you are totally wrong, and I can understand that th situation is much more ``confusing for a non-Italian like you``:  Both ``Libro d'oro della Nobiltà Italiana`` and ``Annuario della Nobiltà Italiana`` are and ever was private publications. You are made a confusion whit the register kept in the former Consulta Araldica del Regno d'Italia, with the identical name of the first publication mentioned, it is the ``Libro d'oro della Nobiltà Italiana`` as well, but has never been published nor updated because was a manuscript register for internal use of the former ``Consulta Araldica del Regno``, the past Italian State bureau in charge of heraldic matters. After the fall of the Monarchy in Italy, and with the new Republican Consitution,  the ``Consulta Araldica del Regno`` has been closed (in force of the ``XIV disposizione transitoria della Costituzione Italiana`` that state ``La legge regola la soppressione della Consulta Araldica``). As a consequence, the ``Libro d'Oro`` manuscript register, ceased to be updated, (BTW!), and now stay in the ``Archivio Centrale dello Stato`` in Rome where anybody can ask for and see it, as you can check here in the Archive official site. I'm aware that recently, under the direction of the same ``Archivio Centrale dello Stato``, two volumes of the manuscript has been published in a ``faxsimile`` or ``photografic`` reproduction, by the same Archivio Centrale dello Stato. those are the details: ``Alle radici dell’identità nazionale. Prosopografie storiche italiane. Libro d’oro della nobiltà (I – II), sotto la direzione di Enrico Cuozzo e Guglielmo de‟ Giovanni – Centelles, con la presentazione del Sovrintendente Aldo G. Ricci, Roma, Società italiana di scienze ausiliarie della storia, 2009, pp. 291. cc.199,cc.199, ill. Riproduzione facsimilare per il 150° anniversario dell‟Unità d‟Italia, 1861 -2011.`` as you can check for yourself here, in the cited ``Archivio Centrale dello Stato`` official publications catalogue. Coming back on the two private publications, the ``private`` ``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libro_d%27Oro_della_Nobilta_Italiana Libro d'Oro della nobiltà Italiana]`` has been published and updated almost regularly (every 3-4 year, more or less) from more that a century, since 1910 to the present day (the most recent (24nd) edition was published in September 2010) by the publisher, the ``Collegio Araldico`` in Rome, an ancient and reputed institution (here the website. The second publication you mentioned, the ``Annuario della Nobiltà Italiana``, has been a totally  private publication too, founded in 1878 by `` Accademia Italiana d'Araldica``, an other reputed institution, and has been published almost regularly has well, but just until 1905, when the ``Accademia`` has been closed and the Annuario ceased definitely to be published (due of the founder death). After almost a century, in the year 2003, a small Italian publisher, the SAGI publishing House (here the website) established a new publication with the same title and same style, adding ``notables families`` and families not resident in Italy. This new Annuario della Nobiltà Italiana has been published irregularly every two or three years and the latest edition, the fourth of the new publication, dated 2007–2010. In Italy at the present, exists some more publication or ``Nobility register`` like the ``Libro d'oro`` and  the ``Annuario`` , all privately published as well, (BTW), they are the ``Elenco dei Titolati Italiani`` and the ``Albo d'oro delle Famiglie Nobili e notabili Italiana ed Europee``. Finally, about your assertion that this small italian ``Dukedom or Duchy`` of San Donato ``is not mentioned``, as for the evident confusion you made about the Italian ``peerage`` books, you should explain precisely at which publication you where referring to.

But, anyway, I thought I'd drop by and explain my reasons for pulling the cite from the first sentence of the article. Per WP:LEDECITE: NEWLINE_TOKENLeads are usually written at a greater level of generality than the body, and information in the lead section of non-controversial subjects is less likely to be challenged and less likely to require a source.... NEWLINE_TOKENPedantic semantic squabbling aside, I don't think there's anyone who contests the validity of the characterization of MM as ``progressive.`` Given that the same assertion is sourced exactly one paragraph later, I think the citation should be cut from the lede. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll that said, I'm not sold on MM being a reliable source for characterizations about itself. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that MM described itself as ``impartial`` (it doesn't, btw). Would it be alright, then, for Wikipedia to describe MM as an ``impartial media watchdog,`` replete with cite to their web site? IMO, MM can't be a WP:RS for information about MM; they're biased, and anything they say about themselves is inherently POV. What's more, if we're not taking MM at their word, but, instead, only citing them for claims that Wikipedia editors find credible, that's differently problematic for being WP:OR. It's not our place to weigh the veracity of primary sources; we shouldn't even be using them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo the end of sidestepping the whole issue, I'd like to offer this source instead for the claim that MM is a progressive organization: . But I don't think it should appear in the lede, either.

Everything you are talking about had been discussed at length at Talk:Ruđer Bošković and the result is the final section of that particular article. Go read it. Secondly, you have absolutely no clue how the discussion on Talk:Croats went and why we ended up having those people there. If you must know, we had a poll in which 15 editors voted. In addition, we defined what a ``Croat`` means and agreed not to include people who might be contentious and attract vandalism. That's the reason why suggestions like Ante Pavelić, Nikola Tesla or even John Malkovich (who were all sugested) were dropped from the very beginning. Of course, you may decide on a different set of criteria. I was against Andrić but he indeed was born as a Croat, was he not? And anyway how does that exclude him from appearing here?

Alot of people contribute to this page and you seem to want to delete EVERYONES work. The reality is there is very little documentation on Trance music in texbooks. This poses a problem. In this scenario the Wiki relies on the followers of the genre to input their expertise FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. If this weren't the case the page would be almost absolutely empty with nothing in it. I know you like to say there are rules for this and that, but in this case because there is no documented research, it is all we can work with. Be happy with what is provided. Lastly the removing of Discogs as a reference is the most bizarre thing I've ever heard. Trance music is about the music...and it was experienced through records NOT BOOKS.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Wrong date? ==NEWLINE_TOKEN``In Europe`` states Pandora's Box is from 1928, ``Filmography`` states it's from 1929. Which one is correct?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: The authoritative Louise Brooks Society lists it as 1929.  The movie was still be filmed when Brooks turned 22; there's a picture of cast & crew celebrating it on the London attic set.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Philosophy ==NEWLINE_TOKENI remember reading in one news article about this individual, it was brief and cryptic, concerning pessimistic aesthetics philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.NEWLINE_TOKENThere seems an unnerving concentration on the film persona (particularly with the one from ``Box``, which I do not think is the best image to dwell on, given that it is one of dehumanization and objectification for varyous fetishistic obsessive types). I have a strong intuition that there was infact ALLOT more to this person then what is being focused on by what appears to be a majority of her fans. Is there any further detail in any of the Seven Seals concerning her philosophy, ideology, and maybe even politics (and at best, religion)? Given her scholarly nature, I strongly doubt any real resemblance to the character of that film. Seek the Forms  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Tone? ==NEWLINE_TOKENHi all, glad to read this article, & I think Louise Brooks is way cool, but I have a quibble:  Here & there, it tends to read like a fansite (i.e., a bit gushy) instead of an encyclopedia article.  Does anyone else have this impression?  I think a few word changes might help.  I can take a shot at it.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Oh yeh I have. That and the fact that there is a marked lack of any of her philosophies. I see her, first and foremost, a scholar, who wrote film reviews and seven esseys (their subject is not given in this artical), or even any philisophical works (though, they may have been very, very diluted, given that Shopenhauer was a major influence on her, he held a nihilistic perversion of Neo-Platonism that would lead to social anarchy, followed by dictatorship by the Nietzscheans). I have bumped into this recently and was somewhat impressed, though, not satisfied with a lack of insight into her potentially more important contributions (if any). The secret here is, I suspect most of these people are just obsessed perverts (fans, like you said). Thanks   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIdeArchos: Giv";3009;0.0

430960037;NEWLINE_TOKEN:: I didn't initiate the attacks, just responded to them in turn. Calling them nuts was euphemistic. I could have called them turkeys as well. Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article.

The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition.

430977401;NEWLINE_TOKENAnother theory of mine owner of this site, the reason why Doug has now appeared out of nowhere, is due to the fact that the other 2 people couldn't revert after a certain point or else they would break this 3 edit rule. Notice how now this fellow Doug has appeared, blocked, then reverted the last edit I made. This I believe is an error of the system. It allows people to collaborate. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe reality is Roux I suspect has some agenda. Wikipedia must understand that the Trance scene is currently being sidestepped by the House scene in a major way. Mainland Europe as of 2011 has practically lost it's Trance festivals. The rosters on the mainstages are almost exclusively House now. Trance generally has contained since the year 2000 some of the most loyal 'drones' in the dance market. The type of people who dislike anything outside of Trance music. Almost obsessive compulsive types. I suspected this behavior in Pengowl originally also. Then Roux appeared. Both of them would monitor anytime I appeared on the page. Trance followers often dislike much attachment to House, because the House scene has practically overshadowed the whole Trance scene currently, and due to the fact that House came first. This may give a certain editor (Roux) certain agenda's to have cited information silenced or to disqualify a citation. I suspected Roux was a Trance follower from his comments on Paul Oakenfold and also the clues telling me what year he entered the scene. I am guessing 1992 or even later - (Trance scene actually started 1987-1988). There also are other possible motives for deleting my important entry. So once again Wikipedia owner, this is likely the reason why Roux is trying to find some rule or anything he can to prevent that one sentence and those two citations from being included. Why? Because they demonstrate that the earliest published Trance works are actually from the UK Acid House movement - thus one can conclude that Trance had origins from the English House scene - which Trance people would HATE WITH A PASSION ) (Right now the world is to believe that it comes from mainland Europe only - there is zero reference to England, which in fact had one of if not the largest Trance scenes in the early years).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENInformation is just information. I personally don't have any pure attachment to House or Trance. I enjoy both, but one must speak about the origins. To silence the past is in a way misinforming an entire generation of newcomers to the scene. Few people can speak about the past because those early critical warehouse years were the beginnings of the scene. What may sound like a few years to you, in reality there is a big difference to someone who appeared in the scene in 1987 as opposed to someone who appeared in 1992. It is also difficult for anyone to speak of the origins of Trance without living through classic Chicago House in the 1980's. There is little to no documentation on the early years of Trance. The documentation that does exist is often written from the perspective of DJs or writers who did not live through classic Chicago House therefore it is difficult for them to piece together the past. To speak of the actual catalog releases of the creators of the music is extremely important in my opinion. In fact, the records themselves (the only medium that the art was released through in the early years) are the actual only true un-biased reference to the genre, wouldn't you agree? At the end of the day, Trance doesn't exist in space, it exists in published form contained on a vinyl record. I am not sure why the site would want me to avoid speaking about the creators of that art.  ;1652;0.0

431638161;People need to seriously stop calling what goes on at this talk page the forming of 'consensus'. This lastest round included, it is at best just a series of long and rambling discussions involing the 'regulars' making and repeating ad nauseum the same largely POV points, and which always bizarrely seems to end in a vote or other exercise in 1-member-1-voice form of accounting. There's not a single thing about that process which is encouraged on Wikipedia if the goal is to actually form WP:CONSENSUS. The fact that as ever the process has not a single element of independent review or summarisation, and has been as ever completely lite on policy, guideline or reference to common good practice on other peer reviewed articles, only underscores that. And right to the end we still bizarrely had claims that keeping the footnote was acceptable, due to the rather obvious fact that these unproductive rambling sessions more often than not end up with no discernable support for doing anything, so leaving the article in a state in which it could never become Featured because it's such a giant policy violating crap bag, somehow turns out to be the 'consensus'. It cannot be so, by definition.

433091679;NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI had the same problem awhile back: I added an external links section with the IMPDB and it was undone immediately thereafter under the external links rules, but I feel that's a complete misinterpretation of the guidelines. The rule (or rules if you include both 4 and 12) is/are intended to keep things clean by not linking to pathetic wikis with lotsa vandalism and/or blatant spam. The IMPDB is neither, having been fairly stable, well organized, and growing at a considerable rate (several articles per week). It's still new, but based on the firearms database and quite well done. A link to the planes database is really no different than all the many links to Wookiepedia, Memory Alpha, and the Muppet wiki among others, albeit on a smaller scale. Continually denying this external link simply prevents this article from having a solid external resource, and, I would add, is a bit hypocritical.

433484316;`I'm really glad that I can help keep your spirits up ! at the moment I'm having problems that prevent me from wanting to edit altogether, so I'm very glad I can be of help in some way. Don't give up, the future is bright !NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, onto matters at hand,. about the new sections I made, when I did so, I had in mind material that isn't yet inside the article, stuff still to come, and really, I've completed work on the index, it will last in the format I last left it for a few years at least.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are things that have nothing to do with education, like that twit martha steward i found, sorry, she's not my cup of tea, but she is appealing to many, popular, and like the pope, needs mentioning on that basis. So there are things that come under culture that are really diverse. Like the pope. And movies, songs, things like that referring to the ISS, it's all under cultural outreach. I didn't have any time to add links to those people, you could work there, also, if you can find any effective way to get google to find other famous people, or a list somewhere, you could pick out the ones that are famous, but please leave out boring ones like politicians, they all call the station and nobody wants to read about it, it's useless fluff. Besides famous people there are other things that go into that category, but I'll get to that later. You could find and add a video for a classroom linkup session. although you'd need to be prepared to ask for permission to have it released into the public domain, I've been doing that and I'm waiting on two responses and have had success with two others, and added them to wiki. All you need to do is write an email and ask them to release an image you want into the public domain, or give you one that they want to release. Just be polite, and explain that anyone from that time will be able to draw all over their work and so forth, I told Ralph kids would draw aliens on his pic for example. It wasn't the original one I asked for but it didn't matter as it does the job for that section.

Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMaba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.

435579776;`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Maba Diakhou Bâ ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMaba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba's article.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMaba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history asNEWLINE_TOKENThe Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.

For example, the page for Madonna doesn't redirect to her full name. I think that's the reason for the choice here - convention is to favour nicknames where the majority of English-speakers (and therefore users of the English-speaking wikipedia) would recognise the nickname without necessarily recognising the name.

436961797;I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:#A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album).

Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review.

437144385;"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN left the following message on my talk page: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI love how you just undid all my work on the Eddie Brock page without asking me to change or edit. Thanks so much for being considerate. Unsourced original reasearch? Its already sourced at the bottom of the page , do you really need me to resource it? NEWLINE_TOKENIt's all in Amazing Spider-Man and it's all characterization which is completely essential to the article whether you fail to realize that or not. So you removed it stating that it could be integrated into the publication section...IT WAS ALREADY INTEGRATED THERE BEFORE YOU REMOVED IT.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI’m sorry that you’re upset over the removal of the material you added, but part of editing on Wikipedia means that your edits may be mercilessly edited, and if the material you add is found to be in violation of policy, then editors required to remove it. They are not under any obligation to ask your permission to do so, and in general, the Wikipedia community is not going to rearrange the way they do things in order to suit the demands of a newcomer. Rather, it is your obligation to learn the ropes here.  Responding to my rather polite post above, in which I complimented your work, and provided links to the relevant policies in question, with the message you left on my talk page, which was rather rude in tone, and ended with an all-caps remark (which is considered the equivalent of yelling on the Net), is a violation of the Wikipedia's Civility Policy, and is not the best way to show the community that you’re willing to be a part of it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor now, I’ll put aside your message to me, and try to explain a bit further the policies in question. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, Wikipedia’s Verifiability Policy does require that we source the material we add to articles, so that readers can verify the material. They cannot do this if we do not inform them of where the material comes from.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe sources in question have to be reliable.

I know you don't have much reason to by sypmathetic with me due to my anti-Semetic trolling (*I* thought it was funny....) but my edits, with the exception of one where I was unaware of policy and had never heard of the guy (Howard Jacobson delete attempt), are in keeping with the spirit of wiki. The sentence Soosim keeps removing is accurate and has been properly sourced.

Quite aside from the glaring COI issue of an organisation paying people to promote their exhibits, nobody has even touched on the tax issues of paid editing being channelled (directly or indirectly) through the WMF. As you may know, I'm generally supportive of the idea of paid editing—I don't see how someone paid to promote an organisation differs from a fan of a band writing about said band, provided the COI is declared and the writer adheres to NPOV—but the talkpage of an almost moribund WikiProject is certainly not the place to unilaterally overturn what was a pretty overwhelming consensus at WP:Requests for comment/Paid editing. –  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: So you had serious and substantial reservations, and you decided to express them by making provocative comparisons? It's like the Wikipedia version of Godwin's Law.NEWLINE_TOKEN: I've already made my own arguments about the importance of intent and outcome in ``paid editing``, on the discussion page itself.  Saying that the British Museum is ``paying people to promote their exhibits``, is at odds with the facts of this situation (as Liam has explained). I have no comment on ``tax issues``, and consider that outside of the community's remit in any case — it can be dealt with by the Foundation, if indeed money is being ``channeled through`` the latter. Your comments on circumventing community consensus have no relevance to me; if you'd like to make a big drama-fest out of somebody offering incentives to write featured-quality articles about notable historical artifacts, then I invite you to do so and see what response you get. —  •  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::No, I had serious and substantial reservations, as did David Cane, and we listed them in great detail at the time the proposal was announced; to his extreme credit and unlike you, Liam paid the courtesy of answering them in detail rather than posting a rambling personal attack.

First, the ``wedge in the door`` unilateral acceptance of paid editing (if the BM pays me £500 to edit on their behalf, how do we then tell  of the British Medical Journal's marketing department that she's banned from editing articles on medical journals?). I use the name of Kohs because he was the ``test case`` that determined our rules on this kind of thing, not because he's some kind of sacred totem. Secondly, there's the issue of the sheer illegality of it. Payments to volunteers, other than genuine and receipted expenses claims and whether in cash on in kind, are flat-out illegal; either someone's a contract worker and gets paid minimum wage (and taxed accordingly), or they're a true volunteer and don't get paid. (There's a single exception, for one-off ex gratia honoraria to long-serving volunteers, which HMIC sometimes accept as non-taxable gifts, but even they still need to be declared and will still be deducted from any means-tested benefits.) Has Mike Godwin, the WMF board or even Alison Wheeler signed off on this arrangement? –  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you'd really enjoy a protracted tone argument, I continue to contend that posting unhelpful and provocative comparisons is not a constructive contribution to discourse, especially when you had detailed commentary available to link to. For my part, neither is the backhanded insinuation that RfA is your primary ``contribution``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLeaving that aside, I'll refer you to the British Museum's legal department to raise any legal concerns — I don't have any reason to believe that the Foundation has any role at all in this initiative, nor that the role of Wikimedia UK extends beyond an advisory one. I'll presume for the sake of my own sanity that they know what they're talking about.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy contention is that these facts work in the favour of the Museum: It accepts Wikipedia's quality standards, it distances itself from editorial control over article content, it is a non-profit with a shared mission with the Wikimedia Foundation, and it involves writing about objects with real providence and public interest. You might not be able to see a bright-line distinction, but a distinction definitely exists — these issues are always about trading off advantages and limitations of different approaches, and it's my contention that in this case there is a real, tangible benefit to Wikipedia's quality, and mitigated, comparably minuscule, conflict of interest concerns. I definitely don't agree that ``If we let them do it, we have to let others do it!`` is a cogent argument — the trade-off works out differently in all situations, and there's no reason to think that other situations can't be handled with thought and judgement instead of a hard rule for or against any editing for monetary benefit. —  •  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:That's fair. Regarding my point 1, I think we're going to have to disagree about the COI issue. I am using MyWikiBiz as an example for a reason; while I know you were around back then I'm not sure how involved you were in the whole saga around it, and it can't be repeated enough that (a) the case set a very clear ``no paid editing ever`` policy on Wikipedia, and (b) the proposed arrangement—in which paid-edits would be written off-wiki or in a dedicated space, and only moved into mainspace once they'd been ``signed off`` as neutral by someone completely uninvolved—was more open and accountable than the proposed BM model. (Greg Kohs may be a disruptive loon now, but back then he was just a developer at Comcast who thought he'd stumbled on a mutually beneficial way to improve Wikipedia's coverage of corporations, and give corporations a first foothold on a rapidly growing new medium that was incomprehensible to most advertising departments.

As you may know, I'm generally supportive of the idea of paid editing—I don't see how someone paid to promote an organisation differs from a fan of a band writing about said band, provided the COI is declared and the writer adheres to NPOV—but the talkpage of an almost moribund WikiProject is certainly not the place to unilaterally overturn what was a pretty overwhelming consensus at WP:Requests for comment/Paid editing. –  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: So you had serious and substantial reservations, and you decided to express them by making provocative comparisons? It's like the Wikipedia version of Godwin's Law.NEWLINE_TOKEN: I've already made my own arguments about the importance of intent and outcome in ``paid editing``, on the discussion page itself.  Saying that the British Museum is ``paying people to promote their exhibits``, is at odds with the facts of this situation (as Liam has explained). I have no comment on ``tax issues``, and consider that outside of the community's remit in any case — it can be dealt with by the Foundation, if indeed money is being ``channeled through`` the latter. Your comments on circumventing community consensus have no relevance to me; if you'd like to make a big drama-fest out of somebody offering incentives to write featured-quality articles about notable historical artifacts, then I invite you to do so and see what response you get. —  •  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::No, I had serious and substantial reservations, as did David Cane, and we listed them in great detail at the time the proposal was announced; to his extreme credit and unlike you, Liam paid the courtesy of answering them in detail rather than posting a rambling personal attack. (Still waiting for that explanation of what ``It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions (like RfA) instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others`` is supposed to mean.)NEWLINE_TOKEN::And no, I don't see a difference between Kohs, Shankbone, Sam Blacketer… (insert your personal favourite COI case), and this proposal. There are two completely unrelated issues. First, the ``wedge in the door`` unilateral acceptance of paid editing (if the BM pays me £500 to edit on their behalf, how do we then tell  of the British Medical Journal's marketing department that she's banned from editing articles on medical journals?). I use the name of Kohs because he was the ``test case`` that determined our rules on this kind of thing, not because he's some kind of sacred totem. Secondly, there's the issue of the sheer illegality of it. Payments to volunteers, other than genuine and receipted expenses claims and whether in cash on in kind, are flat-out illegal; either someone's a contract worker and gets paid minimum wage (and taxed accordingly), or they're a true volunteer and don't get paid. (There's a single exception, for one-off ex gratia honoraria to long-serving volunteers, which HMIC sometimes accept as non-taxable gifts, but even they still need to be declared and will still be deducted from any means-tested benefits.) Has Mike Godwin, the WMF board or even Alison Wheeler signed off on this arrangement? –  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you'd really enjoy a protracted tone argument, I continue to contend that posting unhelpful and provocative comparisons is not a constructive contribution to discourse, especially when you had detailed commentary available to link to. For my part, neither is the backhanded insinuation that RfA is your primary ``contribution``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLeaving that aside, I'll refer you to the British Museum's legal department to raise any legal concerns — I don't have any reason to believe that the Foundation has any role at all in this initiative, nor that the role of Wikimedia UK extends beyond an advisory one. I'll presume for the sake of my own sanity that they know what they're talking about.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy contention is that these facts work in the favour of the Museum: It accepts Wikipedia's quality standards, it distances itself from editorial control over article content, it is a non-profit with a shared mission with the Wikimedia Foundation, and it involves writing about objects with real providence and public interest. You might not be able to see a bright-line distinction, but a distinction definitely exists — these issues are always about trading off advantages and limitations of different approaches, and it's my contention that in this case there is a real, tangible benefit to Wikipedia's quality, and mitigated, comparably minuscule, conflict of interest concerns. I definitely don't agree that ``If we let them do it, we have to let others do it!`` is a cogent argument — the trade-off works out differently in all situations, and there's no reason to think that other situations can't be handled with thought and judgement instead of a hard rule for or against any editing for monetary benefit. —  •  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:That's fair. Regarding my point 1, I think we're going to have to disagree about the COI issue. I am using MyWikiBiz as an example for a reason; while I know you were around back then I'm not sure how involved you were in the whole saga around it, and it can't be repeated enough that (a) the case set a very clear ``no paid editing ever`` policy on Wikipedia, and (b) the proposed arrangement—in which paid-edits would be written off-wiki or in a dedicated space, and only moved into mainspace once they'd been ``signed off`` as neutral by someone completely uninvolved—was more open and accountable than the proposed BM model. (Greg Kohs may be a disruptive loon now, but back then he was just a developer at Comcast who thought he'd stumbled on a mutually beneficial way to improve Wikipedia's coverage of corporations, and give corporations a first foothold on a rapidly growing new medium that was incomprehensible to most advertising departments.

I am wondering can you look at the page history; of the article taig and semi-protect the article? I am tempted to revert a 4th time as vandalism but am hesitant as I don't want to get blocked. If you disagree that the article needs semi-protected, no worries. I feel the editor is making the article very POV and is going against NPOV. I kinda knew I shouldn't have tried editing Irish articles lol, politics, but I tend not to follow my gut instincts. -p |  `";303;0.0

There is no debate in the relevant literature over whether female circumcision is in fact mutilation, and Wikipedia should reflect the consensus achieved in verifiable and authoritative sources. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWP:POVTITLE: ``When a significant majority of English-language reliable sources all refer to the topic or subject of an article by a given name, Wikipedia should follow the sources and use that name as our article title (subject to the other naming criteria). Sometimes that common name will include non-neutral words that Wikipedia normally avoids (Examples include Boston Massacre, Rape of Belgium, and Teapot Dome scandal). In such cases, the commonality of the name overrides our desire to avoid passing judgment (see below). This is acceptable because the non-neutrality and judgment is that of the sources, and not that of Wikipedia editors. True neutrality means we do not impose our opinions over that of the sources, even when our opinion is that the name used by the sources is judgmental.``   `;339;0.0

When it comes to move requests, most seem to degenerate into vague debates about google results, or obscure sources from google which provide that one exception that some people will cling to with tooth and nail to avoid a change they don't like.

I promptly informed you both of that policy and its consequences: it was the sort of thing that leads to sitebans and I asked you each to be very careful about logging in properly when editing.  As far as I was aware that matter seemed resolved, until shortly afterward a checkuser caught you using two administrator accounts.  That news surprised me as much as anybody.  You had been warned very clearly about account sharing within about two weeks before ArbCom had to deal with it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Then, when the checkuser caught you, you posted a claim onsite that you had never shared anyone else's account besides those two administrators.  That was untrue; you had shared another account.  Your claim compelled me to disclose the other incident to the Committee, and I discussed with an arbitrator another possibility: you might have persuaded those two administrators to lend you their account passwords after I warned you about the role account policy.  A comparison of the chat log to your login would have determined which came first, but it was never undertaken.  We hoped you had learned your lesson.  The account sharing incident at Simple Wikipedia was a disappointment.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::In early 2009 you asked me to mentor you and I declined.  Shortly afterward an arbitrator informed me that the Committee was ready to bring you back to en:wiki early with me as your mentor, and the arbitrator communicated it as pretty much a done deal that only needed to be formalized.  Both the arbitrator and I were unpleasantly surprised: I had been entirely unaware that you were negotiating with the Committee, and they had been completely unaware that I refused to mentor you.  Your persuasive skills are admirable: although you had approached me shortly after I had informed the Committee that I would not undertake any new mentorships, they trusted your word and believed I would mentor you anyway.  If recollection serves, at least one of them even attempted to change my mind and mentor you.  Those circumstances obligated me to reply to the Committee that the deceptive way you had undertaken your appeal demonstrated that you were unsuitable for an early return and that you were unlikely to benefit from anyone's mentorship. It was also surprising that they assumed you were more credible than me about that, but to quote Robert Heinlein, ``A committee is a life form with six or more legs and no brain.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::These are circumstances which until now few Wikipedians have known.
